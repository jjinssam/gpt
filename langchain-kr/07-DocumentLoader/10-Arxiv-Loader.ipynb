For example, it was shown that even\\ndemonstrations with invalid reasoning can lead to\\nsimilar performance compared to valid demonstra-\\ntions (Wang et al., 2023)2. Hence, it is not clear\\nhow language models learn to reason effectively\\nbased on the chain-of-thought demonstrations. On\\nthe other hand, mistakes in the intermediate steps\\ncan compound and derail the reasoning process\\n2Note that while chain-of-thought can be performed in\\na zero-shot fashion with prompts, we focus on the few-shot\\nsetting, as it was originally proposed in Wei et al. (2022b).\\narXiv:2311.09277v1  [cs.CL]  15 Nov 2023\\n(Ling et al., 2023). Any potential error in the rea-\\nsoning process not only affects the accuracy of the\\nfinal result but also undermines the trustworthiness\\nof the language model (Turpin et al., 2023). Thus,\\nit is also important to reduce mistakes in intermedi-\\nate reasoning steps.\\nTo address the challenges of chain of thought,\\nwe are inspired by how humans can learn from pos-\\nitive as well as negative examples. For instance,\\nwhen solving a complex task where the intermedi-\\nate steps are not well-defined, it is useful to learn\\nthe correct steps from positive demonstrations, as\\nwell as avoiding faults in negative demonstrations.\\nHence, we propose contrastive chain of thought,\\nwhich provides both positive and negative demon-\\nstrations to enhance the reasoning of language mod-\\nels. Naturally, this raises the question of how to\\ndesign effective negative demonstrations, as well\\nas whether they can be generalized to diverse tasks.\\nThrough our analysis of multiple invalid reasoning\\ntypes, we design a simple and effective method\\nthat can automatically generate contrastive demon-\\nstrations from existing valid reasoning chains. Fur-\\nthermore, as contrastive chain-of-thought is task-\\nagnostic and compatible with methods such as self-\\nconsistency (Wang et al., 2022), we believe that\\nit can serve as a general enhancement of chain of\\nthought.\\nTo measure the effectiveness of contrastive chain\\nof thought, we present evaluations on a wide range\\nof reasoning benchmarks, and find significant ben-\\nefits. Notably, compared to conventional chain of\\nthought, we observe improvements of 9.8 and 16.0\\npoints for GSM-8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and Bam-\\nboogle (Press et al., 2023) respectively when using\\nGPT-3.5-Turbo3, a widely used LLM. Further anal-\\nysis of the reasoning chains generated from our\\nmethod also shows significant reduction in errors.\\nIn summary, our main contributions include: (1)\\nWe analyse various invalid reasoning types and\\nfind that combining positive and negative demon-\\nstrations generally boost the effectiveness of chain-\\nof-thought. (2) Based on the analysis above, we\\npropose contrastive chain of thought to enhance lan-\\nguage model reasoning. To improve generalization,\\nwe also propose an automatic method to construct\\ncontrastive demonstrations. (3) Evaluations on mul-\\ntiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate significant\\nimprovements compared to conventional chain of\\nthought.\\n3https://platform.openai.com/docs/models\\n2\\nPreliminary Study: Effect of Different\\nTypes of Contrastive Demonstrations\\nWhile chain of thought (CoT) prompting has en-\\nhanced the reasoning of large language models, it\\nremains less well understood. For instance, while\\nsound reasoning seems intuitively important to ef-\\nfective chain of thought, previous work has shown\\nthat there is little effect when using invalid demon-\\nstrations. On the other hand, previous works in\\ncontrastive learning (Khosla et al., 2020) and align-\\nment (Ouyang et al., 2022) have demonstrated how\\nlanguage models can learn more effectively from\\nboth valid and invalid examples. Hence, we con-\\nduct a preliminary study with the following re-\\nsearch question: Can invalid reasoning demon-\\nstrations be instead used to enhance chain of\\nthought? Specifically, we aim to study the effect\\nof providing chain-of-thought demonstrations in a\\n“contrastive” manner, i.e., demonstrations contain-\\ning both valid and invalid rationales.\\n2.1\\nComponents of Chain of Thought\\nCompared to standard prompting with in-context\\ndemonstrations (Brown et al., 2020), chain-of-\\nthought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al., 2022b) in-\\ncludes a rationale for each demonstration example.\\nEach rationale consists of a series of intermedi-\\nate reasoning steps, guiding the language model to\\nsolve tasks in a step-by-step manner. Following the\\nformulation of (Wang et al., 2023), we identify two\\ndistinct components of each CoT rationale:\\n• Bridging objects are the symbolic items that\\nthe model traverses in order to reach the final\\nsolution. For example, the objects could be\\nnumbers and equations in arithmetic tasks, or\\nthe names of entities in factual tasks.\\n• Language templates are the textual hints that\\nguide the language model to derive and con-\\ntextualize the correct bridging objects during\\nthe reasoning process.\\n2.2\\nWhat is Invalid Chain of Thought?\\nGiven the distinct components of chain of thought,\\nwe are now able to systematically identify the as-\\npects which lead to invalid rationales. Concretely\\nthere are two main aspects which are applicable to\\nboth the language and object components:\\n• Coherence refers to the correct ordering of\\nsteps in a rationale, and is necessary for suc-\\ncessful chain of thought.

(2023), we\\ninclude invalid reasoning as a category of invalid\\nchain of thought, which is neither incoherent nor\\nirrelevant, but contains logical mistakes. Hence,\\nwe aim to study the five main categories of invalid\\nchain-of-thought, as shown in Figure 2.\\n2.3\\nExperimental Setup\\nTo conduct the experiments for the preliminary\\nstudy, we leverage the GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021)\\nand Bamboogle (Press et al., 2023) datasets for\\narithmetic and factual reasoning respectively.

To study\\nthe effect of contrastive demonstrations under vari-\\nous settings, we evaluate the five main invalid cat-\\negories as shown in Figure 2. Note that we use\\n4-shot prompting for each dataset, and the chain-of-\\nthought demonstrations are manually constructed\\nby previous works (Wei et al., 2022b; Wang et al.,\\n2023).

This suggests that\\nlanguage models are better able to learning step-\\nby-step reasoning when provided with both valid\\nand invalid rationales. Hence, we believe that con-\\ntrastive demonstrations have the potential to greatly\\nenhance language model reasoning ability.\\n3\\nContrastive Chain of Thought\\nChain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, as evidenced\\nby prior research, has indeed elevated the reasoning\\ncapabilities of large language models (Wei et al.,\\n2022b). However, a comprehensive understand-\\ning of this phenomenon is still lacking. Although\\nlogically sound reasoning appears to be inherently\\ncrucial for chain of thought, prior studies surpris-\\ningly reveal minimal impact when employing in-\\nvalid demonstrations. To this end, based on our\\npreliminary study in Section 2, we found that pro-\\nviding both valid and invalid reasoning demonstra-\\ntions in a “contrastive” manner greatly improves\\nreasoning performance. However, this approach\\nmay not generalize well to new tasks, as it requires\\nmanual construction of the invalid rationales.\\nThus, we propose a general prompting method\\nknown as contrastive chain of thought, which\\nincludes automatic construction of contrastive\\ndemonstrations. Figure 3 presents an overview of\\nour approach. Specifically, the language model is\\nprovided with the question, ground truth answer ex-\\nplanation and incorrect answer explanation. Com-\\npared to standard prompting, our method enables\\nmodels to perform more complex reasoning by de-\\ncomposing problems into intermediate steps. Com-\\npared to conventional chain-of-thought prompting,\\nour method contrasts the valid and invalid answer\\nexplanations, guiding the model to generate more\\naccurate reasoning chains.\\nConcretely, given a small set of n in-context\\ndemonstration examples D = {E1, . . . , E|n|}, and\\na query Q, the goal of the model is to generate a\\nsuitable answer A. For standard prompting, the\\ndemonstration examples consist of just the ques-\\ntion and answer, i.e., Ej = (Qj, Aj).

As shown in the figure above,\\nthe reasoning steps T typically consist of multi-\\nple sentences where each sentence describes one\\nreasoning step. Hence, chain-of-thought prompt-\\ning examples consist of the question, reasoning\\nsteps, and final answer, i.e., Ej = (Qj, Tj, Aj).\\nHowever, the model does not know what faults\\nto avoid in conventional chain-of-thought, which\\ncould lead to increased mistakes and error prop-\\nagation. Hence, our contrastive chain of thought\\nmethod provides both the correct and incorrect rea-\\nsoning steps in the demonstration examples, i.e.,\\nEj = (Qj, Tj,+, Aj,+, Tj,−, Aj,−).\\nTo obtain the correct reasoning steps T+ for the\\ndemonstration examples, we use the annotated ex-\\namples from the previous chain-of-thought works.\\nFor the incorrect reasoning steps T−, we automati-\\ncally construct it from the correct reasoning steps\\nT+, based on the \"Incoherent Objects\" category in\\nSection 2. Concretely, we use an existing entity\\nrecognition model5 to extract the object spans such\\nas numbers, equations, or persons from a given\\nchain-of-thought rationale. Consequently, we ran-\\ndomly shuffle the position of the objects within the\\nrationale, thus constructing a rationale with inco-\\nherent bridging objects. Note that when testing\\nwith a new question, only the question and demon-\\nstration examples are provided to the model, and\\nthe model must generate its own reasoning steps\\n5https://spacy.io/models/en#en_core_web_trf\\nbefore producing the final answer.\\n4\\nExperiments\\n4.1\\nExperimental Setup\\nWe focus our study on two main types of reasoning\\ntasks: arithmetic reasoning and factual question\\nanswering (QA).

To maintain a reasonable computing\\nbudget, we limit each dataset to a maximum of\\n500 test samples through random sampling. For\\ndatasets that contain less than 500 test samples, we\\ninstead use all available test samples. The datasets’\\ndetails are included in Table 3. Regarding model\\nand prompting details, we use the same experimen-\\ntal setup as for our preliminary study in Section\\n2.\\n4.2\\nMain Results\\nTo assess the effectiveness of our method, we eval-\\nuate on several reasoning tasks and report the main\\nresults in Table 2. Our main findings are as follows:\\nContrastive CoT demonstrates consistent im-\\nprovements\\nover\\nconventional\\nCoT.\\nCon-\\ntrastive CoT consistently outperforms conventional\\nCoT across the datasets in both arithmetic and fac-\\ntual reasoning categories. Notably, we observe\\nsubstantial gains of more than 10 points on GSM-\\nHard, SVAMP, ASDIV, Bamboogle and Strate-\\ngyQA. Thus, the consistent and significant perfor-\\nmance improvements demonstrate the general ef-\\nfectiveness of our proposed method. As contrastive\\nchain of thought can be automatically constructed\\nfrom existing rationales, the annotation cost is the\\nsame as conventional chain of thought. Hence, it\\ncan be viewed as a general enhancement of chain\\nof thought.\\nContrastive CoT is more effective when ap-\\nplied with self-consistency.\\nAs self-consistency\\n(Wang et al., 2022) is a popular decoding strategy\\nto boost the chain-of-thought performance of large\\nlanguage models, we are interested to see if con-\\ntrastive chain of thought can benefit similarly from\\nself-consistency. In general, we observe that self-\\nconsistency further enhances the performance of\\ncontrastive CoT. This enhancement is particularly\\nevident in the case of the AQuA dataset. While con-\\ntrastive CoT alone results in a modest performance\\nimprovement of 4.0%, applying self-consistency\\namplifies this gain significantly, achieving an addi-\\ntional improvement of 14.2%.\\n5\\nRelated Work\\nLarge Language Models\\nRecent developments\\nin large language models have shown that mas-\\nsively scaling the size and training data of models\\ncan greatly improve generalization (Kaplan et al.,\\n2020). Notably, large language models have been\\nshown to generalize to new tasks when given suit-\\nable prompts and demonstrations (Brown et al.,\\n2020). This has brought about a new paradigm of\\nleveraging language models for tasks without the\\nneed for additional training (Liu et al., 2023). How-\\never, simply scaling language models has not been\\nsufficient to attain good performance on challeng-\\ning tasks such as arithmetic reasoning and factual\\nquestion answering (Wei et al., 2022b). Hence, in\\nthis work, we focus on enhancing the reasoning\\nability of large language models through prompts.\\nChain of Thought\\nChain-of-thought prompting\\nwas introduced by Wei et al. (2022b) to enhance\\nlanguage model reasoning by generating interme-\\ndiate steps. Notably, this has inspired numerous\\nworks that build upon this direction of step-by-\\nstep reasoning. For instance, automatic chain-of-\\nthought (Zhang et al., 2023) was proposed to ad-\\ndress the challenges in manually annotating chain-\\nof-thought demonstrations. On the other hand, it\\nwas shown that specific prompts such as “Let’s\\nthink step-by-step” can enable language models\\nto perform chain-of-thought in a zero-shot man-\\nner, without any demonstrations (Kojima et al.,\\n2022). In addition, challenging problems can be de-\\ncomposed into multiple sub-problems (Zhou et al.,\\n2023), or even into code programs that can be au-\\ntomatically executed (Gao et al., 2023). Despite\\nthe progress in chain-of-thought on multiple fronts,\\nwe still lack a rigorous understanding of the under-\\nlying mechanism (Turpin et al., 2023; Feng et al.,\\n2023). In this work, inspired by the findings of pre-\\nvious works regarding invalid demonstrations, we\\npropose contrastive chain-of-thought to enhance\\nlanguage model reasoning. As contrastive chain-\\nof-thought leverages both valid and invalid reason-\\ning demonstrations, we believe this may encour-\\nage other researchers to fundamentally rethink the\\nchain-of-thought process.\\nLearning from Negative Examples\\nWhile\\nchain-of-thought prompting typically involves only\\nvalid demonstrations, it is not clear whether in-\\nvalid demonstrations can also benefit the reason-\\ning process (Wang et al., 2023).\\nOn the other\\nhand, learning from negative or invalid samples\\nis not new. For instance, contrastive learning is\\na well-established deep learning approach that en-\\ncourages models to distinguish between “positive”\\nand “negative” samples, thus learning better rep-\\nresentations (Khosla et al., 2020). Similarly, rein-\\nforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)\\ntrains a reward model based on positive and neg-\\native samples of human preference data (Ouyang\\net al., 2022; Christiano et al., 2017). Hence, in-\\nspired by the previous approaches, we propose con-\\ntrastive chain-of-thought, a general enhancement\\nof chain-of-thought prompting, by enabling mod-\\nels to learn from both valid and invalid reasoning\\ndemonstrations.\\n6\\nConclusions\\nIn this work, we have explored the effect of leverag-\\ning invalid reasoning demonstrations for enhancing\\nchain of thought. Through our preliminary study\\non different invalid chain-of-thought categories, we\\nfound that providing both valid and invalid demon-\\nstrations in a contrastive manner greatly improves\\nreasoning ability in language models. To overcome\\nthe challenge of manually annotating invalid ratio-\\nnales, we propose contrastive chain of thought, a\\ngeneral prompting method which can automatically\\nconstruct contrastive demonstrations from existing\\nrationales. Through experiments on several reason-\\ning tasks, we find contrastive chain of thought to be\\na general enhancement of chain-of-thought prompt-\\ning. Further investigation into alternative forms of\\nchain-of-thought prompting will hopefully inspire\\nfuture advancements in language-based reasoning.\\nReferences\\nTom Brown, Benjamin Mann, Nick Ryder, Melanie\\nSubbiah, Jared D Kaplan, Prafulla Dhariwal, Arvind\\nNeelakantan, Pranav Shyam, Girish Sastry, Amanda\\nAskell, Sandhini Agarwal, Ariel Herbert-Voss,\\nGretchen Krueger, Tom Henighan, Rewon Child,\\nAditya Ramesh, Daniel Ziegler, Jeffrey Wu, Clemens\\nWinter, Chris Hesse, Mark Chen, Eric Sigler, Ma-\\nteusz Litwin, Scott Gray, Benjamin Chess, Jack\\nClark, Christopher Berner, Sam McCandlish, Alec\\nRadford, Ilya Sutskever, and Dario Amodei. 2020.\\nLanguage models are few-shot learners.\\nIn Ad-\\nvances in Neural Information Processing Systems,\\nvolume 33, pages 1877–1901.

Human thinking is often characterized by\\nits ability to make sudden leaps and connections\\nbetween seemingly unrelated ideas, which can lead\\nto novel insights and solutions. This non-linear,\\njumping thought process is a hallmark of human\\ncreativity, reasoning, and problem-solving abilities.\\nHowever, it also poses a significant challenge for\\ncognitive modeling and understanding.\\nRecently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have\\nbeen advancing at an unprecedented pace. With\\nthe emergence of breakthroughs such as GPT-\\n3 (Brown et al., 2020), PaLM (Chowdhery et al.,\\n2022), and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), the field of\\nnatural language processing has entered a new\\nera of possibilities. Recent studies (Wei et al.,\\n2022a; Wang et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022) have\\nshown that the reasoning ability of LLMs can be\\nunlocked by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.\\nCoT prompting involves a series of intermediate\\nnatural language rationales that lead to the final\\nanswer. In addition, Zhang et al. (2023) have in-\\ntroduced Multimodal-CoT, which combines both\\nlanguage and visual modalities to help surpass the\\nlimitations of textual information. More detailed\\nrelated works can be found in Appendix A.\\nPrevious works on Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\\nprompting, which have been limited to textual and\\nvisual information, often represented the human\\nreasoning process as sequential thought chains.\\nThis approach overlooks the modeling of humans’\\njumping thought process and neglects to incorpo-\\nrate the complex structural information of reason-\\ning thoughts into the model.\\nConcurrent work\\nTree-of-thoughts (ToT) (Yao et al., 2023) divides\\nthoughts into thought units and models them as a\\ntree-like search process.\\nNevertheless, human cognition transcends this\\ntree structure, exhibiting intricate graph-like for-\\nmations.

Therefore, we aim to enable the concur-\\nrent assimilation of linear and nonlinear cognitive\\nprocesses, surpassing the mere generation of seg-\\nmented thought units. To address the above limi-\\ntation, different from ToT, we propose the Graph-\\nof-Thought (GoT), a novel approach to modeling\\nhuman thought processes not only as a chain but\\nalso as a graph. Our method is based on the assump-\\ntion that the human mind works by connecting and\\nrecombining ideas in a non-sequential, graph fash-\\nion, rather than following a strict sequential chain.\\nBy representing thought units as nodes and connec-\\ntions between thoughts as edges, GoT captures the\\nrich, non-sequential nature of human thinking and\\nallows for a more realistic and logical modeling of\\nreasoning processes.\\nAn example of GoT reasoning is shown in Fig-\\nure 1. Inspired by Multimodal-CoT (Zhang et al.,\\n2023), we have adopted a two-stage reasoning\\nframework. It first generates rationales and then\\ngenerates the final answer based on the predicted ra-\\ntionales. In addition to text features, graph features\\nof GoT are integrated during the rationale genera-\\ntion and answer inference. Specifically, GoT is first\\nconstructed with an Extract-Cluster-Coreference\\n(ECC) process, which simulates the deductive pro-\\ncess in human reasoning. We have used T5 (Raffel\\net al., 2020a) pre-trained language model as our\\nbackbone model. GoT is encoded with a graph\\nattention network and then fused with the original\\nrepresentation via a gated fusion network.\\nFurthermore, we have also presented a multi-\\nmodal GoT, which integrates not only text features\\nand GoT features but also visual features. For our\\nexperiments, we have used both FLAN-Alpaca\\n1 (T5)-base and FLAN-Alpaca (T5)-large as our\\nbackbone models.\\nWe implement GoT as a two-stage framework\\nand fine-tuning language models and integrating\\ntext, thought graph, and vision features for a more\\nrealistic and accurate reasoning process.\\nGoT\\ndemonstrates exceptional performance on both text-\\nonly AQUA-RAT (Ling et al., 2017) and multi-\\nmodal ScienceQA (Lu et al., 2022) benchmarks,\\nsurpassing the accuracy of online system Chat-\\nGPT (OpenAI, 2023) by 9.28%, strong baseline\\nMultimodal-CoT (Zhang et al., 2023) by 2.40%,\\nand even exceeding human performance, establish-\\ning a new state-of-the-art on ScienceQA test set\\nwith far fewer parameters.\\n2\\nGraph-of-Thought\\nThe overview of our proposed GoT can be seen\\nin Figure 2.

Therefore, GoT employs inde-\\npendent encoders to encode input data for each\\nmodality. We use a Transformer encoder to encode\\ninput text, a vision encoder to encode an image, and\\na graph attention network to encode the thought\\ngraph. The encoded features are further passed\\ninto cross-attention to align text tokens with image\\npatches and graph nodes, respectively. We then\\nuse a gated fusion layer to fuse these three features\\nfurther and pass them into the Transformer decoder\\nto predict the target rationales. (2) Answer gener-\\nation stage: The second stage aims at generating\\nthe final answer and is largely similar to the first\\nstage. The main difference is that the input text\\nis concatenated with the predicted rationales from\\nthe first stage. It is worth noting that the above\\nprocess describes a general multimodal reasoning\\nframework. However, for text-only reasoning tasks,\\nthere are no image features, so the image encod-\\ning and vision feature fusion processes mentioned\\nabove can be omitted. In the following section,\\nwe will provide a detailed exposition of the two\\nkey steps of our GoT reasoning framework: GoT\\nconstruction and GoT encoding and feature fusion.\\n2.1\\nGoT Construction\\nGoT employs thought graphs to simulate human de-\\nductive reasoning, thereby modeling humans’ abil-\\nity for leaps of thought. Our aim is to reflect the\\nmost fundamental deduction process by construct-\\ning a thought graph. If we have evidence that x →\\ny and y →z, then it follows that x →z. In Fig-\\nure 3, the deduction reasoning can be formulated\\nas follows: Earthquake\\ncomes from\\n−\\n→\\n{earth, quake},\\n{earth, quake} means\\n−\\n→{ground, shake}. It is easy to\\nreason that Earthquake−\\n→{ground, shake}.\\nWe\\npropose\\na\\nnovel\\nExtract-Clustering-\\nCoreference (ECC) process to construct thought\\ngraphs.\\nECC first extracts deductive triplets\\nT = {ti = (ti\\nx, ti\\ny, ti\\nz)} as the discrete raw graph,\\nwhere ti\\nx, ti\\ny, and ti\\nz are thought units of the i-th\\ntriplet, and there exists an edge ei\\nxy between ti\\nx and\\nti\\ny, and an edge ei\\nyz between ti\\ny and ti\\nz. Then, ECC\\nclusters the nodes that refer to the same mentions\\nto conduct coreference resolution. Specifically,\\nwe replace every graph node that belongs to a\\ncoreference cluster with the most representative\\nmention in the cluster. By adopting this technique,\\nour model is better equipped with denser thought\\ngraphs and the ability for deductive reasoning. The\\ndetailed algorithm is illustrated in Algorithm 1.\\nIn GoT construction, during the rationale gen-\\neration stage, the input text consists of concate-\\nnated question, context, and choices. In multimodal\\nGoT, image caption (Lu et al., 2022) is appended\\nto the input text for GoT to incorporate image in-\\nThe word earthquake \\ncomes from the words \\nearth and quake.

In multimodal GoT reasoning, the image is\\nencoded using an additional vision encoder.\\n2.2.1\\nBase Encoder\\nText Encoder\\nFor text representation, we use the\\nTransformer encoder (e.g. T5 (Raffel et al., 2020a))\\nto encode the input text. Given input sentence S =\\n{w0, ..., wl}, we extract the hidden states from the\\nlast layer of the Transformer encoder to obtain the\\ntext representation HT :\\nHT = {h0, h1, ..., hl} = Encodertext(S)\\n(1)\\nwhere hi is the hidden representation of token i and\\nl represents the length of the text input.\\nVision Encoder (Optional)\\nFor multimodal rea-\\nsoning with vision modality, following (Zhang\\net al., 2023), we extract patch-level features of\\nimage I using readily available vision extraction\\nmodel as vision encoder Encodervision and then\\nemploy a trainable projection matrix WI to project\\nthe extracted features into the vision representation\\nHI which have the same shape with HT .\\nHI = WIEncodervision(I)\\n(2)\\n2.2.2\\nGoT Encoder\\nNode Embedding\\nWe first use special tokens\\n<s> and </s> to highlight every thought graph\\nnode.\\nSpecifically, for node set with j nodes\\nN = {n0, ...nj} , we construct the node input as p\\nand then feed the p into the same text encoder and\\nutilize the output representation of the special token\\n<s> as the initial node representation.

Our GoT encoder employs a multi-head\\ngraph attention layer, following (Velickovic et al.,\\n2018), we concatenate the output of each graph\\nattention layer and further pass it to a output graph\\nattention layer with the same architecture:\\nhg′\\ni = ∥K\\nk=1GELU\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8edX\\nj∈Ni\\nαk\\nijWkhs\\nj\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f8\\n(9)\\nhg′′\\ni\\n= GELU\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8edX\\nj∈Ni\\nαijWhg′\\nj\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f8\\n(10)\\nwhere K is the number of attention heads, || is\\nthe concatenate operation, and n is the number of\\nnodes in thought graph.

In conclusion, our results confirm the\\neffectiveness of utilizing two-dimensional graph-\\nof-thought and demonstrate the potential of incor-\\nporating GoT into reasoning for LMs.\\n4.2\\nFurther Exploration\\n4.2.1\\nAblation Study\\nAQUA-RAT\\nIn order to make sure that intro-\\nducing thought graphs into GoT reasoning indeed\\nboost the performance, we conduct the following\\nexperiments:\\n(1) Random Thought Graph\\nIn the Random Thought Graph experiment, we\\nmaintain the GoT framework while introducing ran-\\ndomness into the process. We construct a thought\\ngraph by randomly selecting nodes and arbitrarily\\nestablishing connections between them. This ap-\\nproach is designed to evaluate the extent to which\\nthe GoT reasoning mechanism is reliant on the\\nstructured organization of thought graphs.\\n(2)\\nTriplets Concatenation In the Triplets Concate-\\nnation experiment, we take a straightforward ap-\\nproach by appending the extracted triplets directly\\nto the input text. This method aims to assess the\\nimpact of omitting the structural information typi-\\ncally provided by thought graphs, offering insight\\ninto the significance of this structural element in\\nthe reasoning process. (3) Coreference Injection\\nIn the Coreference Injection experiment, we ex-\\nplore the potential benefits of integrating corefer-\\nence resolution directly into the language model’s\\nreasoning process. We achieve this by incorpo-\\nrating coreference information into the input text,\\nwhere all instances of coreferent entities are re-\\nplaced with a consistent phrase, followed by model\\nfine-tuning. This experiment seeks to understand\\nthe role of coreference resolution in enhancing the\\nmodel’s deductive capabilities.\\nTable 3 shows the overall ablation results. From\\nthe table, we can see that by randomly construct\\nthought graphs to disrupt the deductive reasoning\\nprocess, our model suffers a loss of 1.78%, indicat-\\ning the effectiveness of GoT.

This performance gap of 0.89\\nclearly demonstrates the significance of the struc-\\ntural information in our approach. For Coreference\\nInjection, the model suffers a loss of 1.77 % ac-\\ncuracy. We believe that these outcomes can be\\nattributed to a couple of factors: (1) Simply re-\\nplacing coreferent entities may lead to a loss of\\ncoherence in sentences, resulting in a reduction\\nof semantic information and consequently having\\na limited impact on overall accuracy. (2) Open\\nInformation Extraction (OpenIE) for coreference\\nresolution is not flawless, and direct replacement\\nof entities might introduce noise that misleads the\\nlanguage model during judgment.\\nContrastingly, the construction of a thought\\ngraph in the GoT framework does not compromise\\nthe original textual information (questions and ra-\\ntionales). Instead, it introduces additional structural\\nassistance for LMs to conduct reasoning effectively.\\nThus, we contend that GoT’s approach is indispens-\\nable and beneficial, as it supplements the LM’s\\ncomprehension without introducing potential noise\\nor loss of coherence in the input text.\\nScienceQA\\nTo examine the impact of different\\nbackbone and vision encoder configurations on the\\nGoT, we employed a distinct set of model settings.\\nMore specifically, we adopted the pre-trained T5\\ncheckpoint UnifiedQA (Khashabi et al., 2020) as\\nthe backbone model and utilized DETR (Carion\\net al., 2020) for the vision encoder, with results\\nillustrated in the Table 4. As shown, our GoT out-\\nperforms Mutimodal-CoT across various model\\nconfigurations. A comparison reveals that GoT\\ncan achieve greater improvements on smaller mod-\\nels. We believe the main reason is that when the\\nlanguage model is not as robust, or when employ-\\ning a relatively weaker vision encoder like DETR\\ncompared to ViT, GoT can leverage the inherent\\ninformation within the language to enhance per-\\nformance significantly. Additionally, to prove that\\nour GoT’s performance gain is not simply due to\\nan increase in parameters, we conducted an abla-\\ntion study. We expanded the parameter count of\\nMultimodal-CoTbase to match our 233M model\\nsize by adding two layers of MLP instead of one in\\nthe gated fusion module, referred to as Multimodal-\\nCoTbase(enlarged). We also constructed a random\\nthought graph ablation study on the ScienceQA\\ndataset. The results from the ablation studies can\\nbe observed in the table 4. From the table, it is\\nevident that our model significantly outperforms\\nthe enlarged Multimodal-CoT by an accuracy of\\n2.04%. These findings convincingly demonstrate\\nthe significance of incorporating thought graphs\\ninto multimodal reasoning. The performance of\\nGoT with a randomly constructed thought graph\\nwas even lower than Mutimodal-CoT, indicating\\nthat when the language model and vision encoder\\nare weaker, the model relies more heavily on GoT\\nfor reasoning.\\nModel\\nACC\\n∆\\nUnifiedQA+DETR\\nMutimodal-CoTbase\\n77.67\\n-\\nMutimodal-CoTlarge\\n81.37\\n-\\nGoTbase\\n81.21\\n3.54\\nGoTlarge\\n82.74\\n1.37\\nAblation Studies\\nMutimodal-CoTbase(enlarged)\\n79.17\\n-2.04\\nGoTbase w/ Random Thought Graph\\n76.74\\n-4.47\\nTable 4: Ablation results of GoT on ScienceQA dataset.\\nFor GoT models ∆indicates the performance gains of\\nGoT models over their Multimodal-CoT counterparts.\\nIn the ablation studies, ∆represents improvements rela-\\ntive to the GoTbase model\\n4.2.2\\nAnalysis\\nPerformance on Different Classes\\nIn order to\\ninvestigate the impact of GoT on the overall model\\nperformance across different subjects , we calcu-\\nlated the accuracy for different subjects and com-\\npared it with that of Mutimodal-CoT. We also\\ncompare the performance of two models on dif-\\nferent question classes.The radar Figure 5 shows\\nthe overall results for our base model. With re-\\nspect to various subjects and question classes, our\\nmodel demonstrates superior performance over the\\nMutimodal-CoTbase and attains a more consistent\\nand enhanced outcome. Our model presents out-\\nstanding advantages especially in the field of social\\nscience, with an accuracy improvement of 5.25%.\\nFor different question classes, our model demon-\\nstrates the largest improvement on questions involv-\\ning images. Our hypothesis is that by constructing\\na thought graph and integrating the three features of\\ntext, image, and thought graph, we can better align\\nthe textual and visual information for the model,\\nthus maximizing the utilization of visual informa-\\ntion and obtaining more accurate answers.\\nFigure 5: Performance on different question classes\\n2\\n4\\n6\\n8\\n10\\n12\\n60\\n70\\n80\\n90\\n100\\nGrades\\nAccuracy(%)\\nOursbase\\nMutimodal-CoTbase\\nFigure 6: Performance on different grades\\nPerformance on Different Grades\\nIt can be\\nseen from the Table 2 that Mutimodal-CoT expe-\\nrience a decrease in accuracy of 1.78 as the grade\\nlevel of the given question increases while GoT\\nonly has minor decrease of 0.56. We believe the\\nmain reason is that by incorporating GoT, models\\nacquires the ability for deductive reasoning and can\\nbetter comprehend the relationships between differ-\\nent entities and thus better understand the meaning\\nof the problems. Through this method, for higher-\\ngrade problems with greater complexity, the model\\ncan construct a thought graph to help itself gener-\\nate a more complete logical chain for deduction,\\nthereby generating more accurate answers. More\\ndetailed model performance on different grades can\\nbe found in Figure 6. We can see that in the lower\\ngrade, two models achieves a similar performance.\\nAs the grade level increases and the difficulty of\\nthe questions becomes more challenging, the gap\\nbetween our model and the Mutimodal-CoT model\\ngradually widens. Due to the small number of ques-\\ntions (≤130) available for each grade in grade 1\\nand grades 11-12, there is greater fluctuation in the\\naccuracy of both models. Nevertheless, it is evident\\nfrom the table that our model exhibits stronger and\\nmore stable advantages over Mutimodal-CoT in\\neach grade.\\nCase Study and Limitation\\nIn order to gain a\\ndeeper understanding of the performance of GoT,\\nwe conduct case studies which can be found in\\nthe Appendix E. We also visualize the attention\\nweights aij in GoT encoder to demonstrate how\\nGoT performs deductive reasoning to generate\\nmore accurate answers in Appendix F. For the lim-\\nitation of this work, compared to CoT, GoT may\\nresult in additional computational costs and slightly\\nslower training times. Detailed limitation analysis\\ncan be found in Appendix G.\\n5\\nConclusion\\nWe introduce a novel Graph-of-Thought (GoT) rea-\\nsoning approach, which is an innovative method\\nfor modeling the non-sequential nature of human\\nthinking for LMs. GoT enhances LMs with deduc-\\ntive reasoning abilities, providing a more realistic\\nrepresentation of thought processes. Our exper-\\niments showcases the superiority of GoT on the\\ntext-only reasoning dataset AQUA-RAT, achieving\\na similar result compared to GPT-3 model while\\nutilizing significantly fewer parameters. Further-\\nmore, GoT establishes a new state-of-the-art on\\nthe multimodal reasoning benchmark, ScienceQA\\nwith fewer parameters. This performance surpasses\\nstrong ChatGPT and GPT-4 systems, as well as hu-\\nman performance, demonstrating the efficacy of\\nGoT. Through comprehensive case studies and ab-\\nlation studies, we provide substantial evidence of\\nthe effectiveness of GoT in reasoning tasks. If you\\nwant it, you GoT it!\\nReferences\\nPeter Anderson, Xiaodong He, Chris Buehler, Damien\\nTeney, Mark Johnson, Stephen Gould, and Lei Zhang.\\n2018.

CoRR, abs/2302.00923.\\nAppendix\\nA\\nRelated Works\\nIn chain-of-thought reasoning, one idea leads to the\\nnext in a logical sequence and builds on previous\\nknowledge. Each idea is supported by evidence\\nor reasoning, and the conclusions drawn from the\\nchain are logical and sound. Most CoT methods\\ncan be divided into two categories based on how to\\ngenerate the final answer: (1) prompting for CoT,\\nincluding zero-shot CoT and few-shot CoT; and (2)\\nfine-tuning for CoT.\\nZero-shot CoT Prompting\\nAs large language\\nmodels continue to advance rapidly, many re-\\nsearchers are beginning to explore CoT reasoning\\nfor LLMs. The zero-shot CoT method proposed\\nby Kojima et al. (2022) consists of two stages: (1)\\nadding a \"Let’s think step by step\" prompt to gener-\\nate CoT, and (2) concatenating the generated CoT\\nand adding the phrase \"So the answer is\" to ob-\\ntain the final answer. Tree-of-Thought (ToT) (Yao\\net al., 2023) enables deliberate decision-making\\nthrough exploration of coherent text units. ToT di-\\nvides thoughts into thought units and models them\\nas a tree-like search process. Although both GoT\\nand ToT aim to capture human non-linear thoughts,\\nGoT is distinct from ToT in terms of both methodol-\\nogy and objectives. We believe that human thinking\\ninvolves both linear and non-linear aspects. Thus,\\nwe build upon the linear CoT framework by in-\\ncorporating non-linear structures to simultaneously\\ncapture both linear and non-linear human reason-\\ning. Tree-of-thoughts focuses on modeling non-\\nlinear thoughts explicitly, whereas our approach\\nleverages non-linear structures to assist the Chain-\\nof-Thought reasoning.\\nFew-shot CoT Prompting\\nFew-shot CoT rea-\\nsoning for LLMs, however, utilizes multiple input-\\noutput pairs to prompt the LLMs to output CoT\\nand obtain the final answer. Due to its ability to\\nprovide better performance compared to Zero-shot\\nCoT, Few-shot CoT has gained more attention in\\nresearch, particularly through effective demonstra-\\ntions. Few-shot CoT prompting was first formally\\nexplored by Wei et al. (2022a) and is a form of dis-\\ncrete prompt learning that involves context learning\\nin large models. Compared to traditional in-context\\nlearning, which prompts LLMs with a list of input-\\noutput demonstration pairs along with a test input\\nto allow the model to predict output, Few-shot CoT\\nprompting outputs additional logical reasoning pro-\\ncedures apart from the target output. Wang et al.\\n(2022) proposed a follow-up method to (Wei et al.,\\n2022a). The main improvement is that the model\\nuses the majority vote for the answers, which was\\nfound to significantly improve the performance of\\nthe CoT. However, these few-shot CoT models de-\\npend on hand-crafted demonstrations. To solve this\\nproblem, Zhang et al. (2022) proposed Auto-CoT,\\nwhich maintains the diversity of sampled questions\\nand generates reasoning chains to automatically\\nconstruct demonstrations. Specifically, Auto-CoT\\nconsists of two main stages: (1) Problem clustering:\\ndivide the given dataset of problems into several\\nclusters; (2) Demonstration sampling: select a rep-\\nresentative problem from each cluster and use a\\nsimple heuristic method to generate its reasoning\\nchain. Furthermore, Lu et al. (2023) also explores\\nfew-shot CoT reasoning for recently popular LLMs\\nChatGPT and GPT-4.\\nCoT Fine-tuning\\nIn Zhang et al. (2023), it was\\nproposed to fine-tune smaller language models in-\\nstead of prompting them in LLMs. And this ap-\\nproach enabled the CoT to go beyond textual infor-\\nmation and incorporate visual (image) modalities\\nusing a gated fusion mechanism into a two-stage\\nCoT. The results demonstrated that CoT fine-tuning\\nwith fewer parameters has potential. Therefore, in\\nthis work, we focus on fine-tuning for CoT to re-\\nduce the number of required model parameters and\\nhelp LLMs better comprehend different modalities.\\nHowever, previous CoT research has been limited\\nto different modalities, such as textual and vision\\ninformation, without considering the deduction rea-\\nsoning process. Therefore, in this work, we move\\nbeyond modeling the reasoning process solely as\\na thought chain and elevate it to a thought graph.\\nWe provide a more comprehensive and nuanced\\nrepresentation, enabling LLMs to perceive the de-\\nduction reasoning process accurately, resulting in\\nmore precise answer generation.\\nB\\nDataset\\nAQUA-RAT dataset consists of about 100,000 al-\\ngebraic word problems with natural language ra-\\ntionales. For AQUA-RAT, the model is trained to\\nreasoning through the steps to generate the final\\nanswer. ScienceQA benchmark is the pioneering\\nlarge-scale dataset for multimodal science ques-\\ntions, equipped with comprehensive annotations for\\nanswers, including detailed lectures and explana-\\ntions. The dataset contains 21k questions covering\\nthree subjects: natural science, language science,\\nand social science. Each question is presented with\\na context in the form of natural language or an\\noptional image. The model is trained to elucidate\\nthe reasoning process in natural language while\\nchoosing the answer from a set of options.\\nSplits\\n#Problems\\nTrain\\n97467\\nDev\\n254\\nTest\\n254\\nTable 5: AQUA-RAT dataset statistics (# denotes num-\\nbers)\\nStatistic\\nNumber\\nSplits\\n#Train\\n12,726\\n#Dev\\n4,241\\n#Test\\n4,241\\n#Total\\n21,208\\nAttribute\\n#Subjects\\n3\\n#Topic\\n26\\n#Category\\n127\\n#Skill\\n379\\nTable 6: ScienceQA dataset statistics (# denotes num-\\nbers)\\nC\\nTraining Parameters\\nParameters\\nValue\\nEpochs\\n100\\nBatch size for T5-base (per device)\\n10\\nBatch size for T5-large (per device)\\n8\\nLearning rate\\n5e-5\\nWeight decay\\n0.01\\nMax input length\\n512\\nMax number of nodes\\n150\\nTable 7: Training parameters for GoT\\nD\\nRationale Generation Results\\nThe rationale genration results can be found in Ta-\\nble 8. We can observe from Table 8 that the im-\\npact of GoT on rationale generation is limited. We\\nattribute this limitation to the fact that the input\\ntext for thought graph construction only includes\\nquestions and choices. Consequently, the thought\\ngraph constructed from such limited information\\ncan only facilitate constrained deductive reasoning.\\nHowever, in the answer generation stage, when pro-\\nvided with rationales, the model needs to possess\\nstronger deductive reasoning capabilities to under-\\nstand the relationship between rationales, questions,\\nand choices.\\nE\\nCase Study\\nTo facilitate a more illustrative comparison between\\nGoT and the CoT, we have selected several repre-\\nsentative examples. Figure 7 illustrates the exam-\\nples from AQUA-RAT dataset. Figure 8 to Figure\\n11 illustrates examples from ScienceQA dataset.\\nFrom Figure 8 and Figure 9, we can see that GoT\\ncan better understand the rationales and generate\\nmore accurate result. In Figure 10, we can see that\\nwhen provided with wrong rationale, our model is\\nmore robust to the noise and can focus on more\\nimportant key information. (We highlight the noisy\\nwrong rationale in red and correct key rationale\\nin green). Figure 11 presents a language prob-\\nlem which have less context and requires a certain\\namount of common sense knowledge. Hence, the\\nimpact of constructing a mind map on enhancing\\nthe model is not significant. Therefore, both GoT\\nand CoT predict wrong answers.\\nF\\nRepresentation Visualization\\nIn order to demonstrate the deductive reasoning\\nprocess of GoT more intuitively, we visualized the\\nattention weights of the GoT encoder. The visu-\\nalization results can be found in Figure 12. We\\ntook Figure 10 as an example. In Figure 10, even\\ngiven a wrong rationale, GoT still manages to gen-\\nerate the right answer. We select 14 representative\\nthought nodes and found that \"blue\",\"color\", and\\n\"common\" have the greatest weights which indi-\\ncates that GoT guides the model to focus on more\\nimportant words and conduct correct deductive rea-\\nsoning. For the disruptive node \"a hard object,\" our\\nmodel can effectively discriminate against it and as-\\nsign a lower attention weight to prevent the model\\nfrom selecting incorrect answers, as traditional CoT\\nmodels often do due to erroneous rationales.\\nG\\nLimitation\\nCompared to Mutimodal-CoT (Zhang et al., 2023),\\nincorporating GoT may result in additional com-\\nputational costs and slightly slower training times.\\nMODELS\\nBLEU1\\nBLEU4\\nROUGE\\nSIMILARITY\\nAQUA-RAT\\nFLAN-Alpacabase\\n19.78\\n3.49\\n28.40\\n68.61\\nFLAN-Alpacalarge\\n22.45\\n5.40\\n29.55\\n70.34\\nGoT-T5base\\n22.05\\n5.02\\n29.18\\n69.09\\nGoT-T5large\\n24.47\\n6.68\\n29.86\\n71.58\\nScienceQA\\nMutimodal-CoT∗\\nbase (Zhang et al., 2023)\\n91.04\\n86.81\\n93.24\\n96.34\\nGoT-T5base\\n92.50\\n88.79\\n94.39\\n96.74\\nGoT-T5large\\n93.49\\n90.09\\n95.17\\n97.33\\nTable 8: Rationale generation results (%).

       " 'Summary': 'Despite the success of chain of thought in enhancing language model\\nreasoning, the underlying process remains less well understood. Although\\nlogically sound reasoning appears inherently crucial for chain of thought,\\nprior studies surprisingly reveal minimal impact when using invalid\\ndemonstrations instead. Furthermore, the conventional chain of thought does not\\ninform language models on what mistakes to avoid, which potentially leads to\\nmore errors. Hence, inspired by how humans can learn from both positive and\\nnegative examples, we propose contrastive chain of thought to enhance language\\nmodel reasoning. Compared to the conventional chain of thought, our approach\\nprovides both valid and invalid reasoning demonstrations, to guide the model to\\nreason step-by-step while reducing reasoning mistakes. To improve\\ngeneralization, we introduce an automatic method to construct contrastive\\ndemonstrations. Our experiments on reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that\\ncontrastive chain of thought can serve as a general enhancement of\\nchain-of-thought prompting.',\n",

The\\ndata and code are released at Github site1.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nThe rapidly evolving field of natural language\\nprocessing (NLP) witnesses the rise of large lan-\\nguage models (LLMs), such as GPT-3(Brown\\net al., 2020), LaMDA(Thoppilan et al., 2022),\\nPaLM(Chowdhery et al., 2022), etc., which have\\nrevolutionized various downstream tasks with in-\\ncontext learning (ICL) (Brown et al., 2020) and\\nchain-of-thought (COT) prompting (Wei et al.,\\n2022c). Excitingly, just by providing appropriate\\ninstructions (Sanh et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022)\\nor chain-of-thought prompts (Wei et al., 2022c),\\nLLMs can achieve amazing performance on the\\n∗Corresponding authors.\\n1https://github.com/RidongHan/\\nEvaluation-of-ChatGPT-on-Information-Extraction\\nzero-shot and few-shot scenarios of unseen tasks,\\neven without updating parameters. Currently, one\\nof the most well-known LLMs is ChatGPT (Ope-\\nnAI, 2023b) powered by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (Ope-\\nnAI, 2023a), which exhibits powerful dialogue ca-\\npabilities. Since ChatGPT is a closed model, and\\nOpenAI does not provide its training details, there\\nare numerous aspects that need to be explored by\\nresearchers. For example, Jiao et al. (2023) evalu-\\nate the machine translation capability of ChatGPT,\\n(Bang et al., 2023) assess the reasoning capability\\nof ChatGPT. Hence, it is time to ask the question:\\nIs information extraction task solved by ChatGPT\\nand to what extent?\\nInformation extraction (IE), as the fundamen-\\ntal natural language understanding task, aims to\\nidentify structured information of interest from un-\\nstructured plain text. Its results directly affect the\\nsubsequent downstream tasks, such as question-\\nanswering (Fei et al., 2022; Cao et al., 2022) and\\nknowledge graph construction (Wang et al., 2022a).\\nTherefore, exploring the ability of ChatGPT to rec-\\nognize target information can more directly reflect\\nChatGPT’s performance on understanding task in-\\nstructions to generate responses.\\nIn this paper, we evaluate ChatGPT’s capabilities\\non IE tasks in terms of four perspectives, including\\nPerformance, Evaluation Criteria, Robustness\\nand Error Types.\\nPerformance\\nWe evaluate the performance of\\nChatGPT on 17 datasets with 14 IE sub-tasks un-\\nder 3 settings: zero-shot prompts, few-shot ICL\\nprompts and few-shot COT prompts. The results\\nindicate the following conclusions:\\n• There is a significant performance gap be-\\ntween ChatGPT and SOTA methods.\\n• The harder the task, the larger the gap.\\n• ChatGPT can equal or exceed SOTA methods\\non a few simple cases.\\narXiv:2305.14450v1  [cs.CL]  23 May 2023\\n• Using few-shot ICL prompts generally leads\\nto significant improvements, but still obvi-\\nously lags behind SOTA results.\\n• The chain-of-thought prompting cannot guar-\\nantee further gains compared to few-shot ICL\\nprompts.\\nEvaluation Criteria\\nThrough the manual check-\\ning, we find that ChatGPT tends to identify longer\\nspans than the annotated ones, i.e., the recognized\\nspans usually contain qualifiers such as crowns,\\nquantifiers, adjectives, time, place, etc. Thus, the\\nprevious span hard-matching strategy is not suit-\\nable for the evaluation of LLMs like ChatGPT that\\ngenerate human-like responses. We propose a soft-\\nmatching strategy to solve this problem and display\\nevaluation results more accurately.\\nRobustness\\nWe conduct comparisons and analy-\\nsis on four dimensions: Invalid Output, Irrelevant\\nContext, Frequency of Target Types and The Order\\nof Entities. We find that:\\n• ChatGPT rarely outputs invalid responses in\\nmost cases.\\n• Irrelevant context and frequency of target\\ntypes have a significant impact on ChatGPT’s\\nperformance.\\n• ChatGPT is not sensitive to the order of en-\\ntities, and cannot accurately understand the\\nsubject-object relationships of entities.\\nError Types\\nWe summarize 7 types of errors\\non IE tasks by manually checking ChatGPT’s re-\\nsponses, including Missing spans, Unmentioned\\nspans, Unannotated spans, Incorrect span offsets,\\nUndefined types, Incorrect types and Other. We\\nfind that “unannotated spans” is the most dominant\\nerror type, accounting for nearly 1/3 of errors. This\\nraises concerns about the quality of the annotated\\ndata. Maybe using ChatGPT to assist in annotating\\ndata is a better solution.\\n2\\nRelated Work\\nLarge Language Models\\nBased on the highly\\nparallelizable Transformer architecture (Vaswani\\net al., 2017), pre-trained language models (PLMs)\\nsuch as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), BART (Lewis\\net al., 2020), etc., have shown powerful capabili-\\nties to solve a wide variety of NLP tasks. Some\\nresearchers find that scaling PLMs by increasing\\nmodel size or data size often leads to more powerful\\ncapabilities, as long as the scaling law is followed\\n(Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022). Thus,\\nnumerous large-size models have been proposed,\\nsuch as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), LaMDA (Thop-\\npilan et al., 2022), MT-NLG (Smith et al., 2022),\\nPaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022) and GPT-4 (Ope-\\nnAI, 2023a), which typically have more than 100\\nbillion parameters. The NLP community refers to\\nthese large-size PLMs as large language models\\n(LLMs). Unlike small-sized PLMs, LLMs usu-\\nally exhibit amazing emergent abilities (Wei et al.,\\n2022b; Schaeffer et al., 2023) that enable them to\\nachieve good performance in zero-shot and few-\\nshot scenarios of unseen tasks, as long as the ap-\\npropriate instructions (Wei et al., 2022a; Kojima\\net al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022b) or chain-of-though\\nprompts (Wei et al., 2022c) are provided.\\nChatGPT\\nOne of the best-known examples of\\nLLMs is OpenAI’s GPT (Generative Pre-Training\\nTransformer) series, including GPT-1 (Radford\\net al., 2018), GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), GPT-\\n3 (Brown et al., 2020), GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023a),\\netc. A key milestone in the development process\\nis InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), a framework\\nfor instruction fine-tuning based on reinforcement\\nlearning from human feedback (RLHF) (Christiano\\net al., 2017). The framework allows a large lan-\\nguage model to be adapted to a large number of\\nNLP tasks simultaneously, and leverages human\\nfeedbacks to align the model output with human\\npreferences in order to generate responses more\\nconsistent with human expectations. As the suc-\\ncessor of InstructGPT, ChatGPT has exploded the\\nfield of artificial intelligence (AI), and attracted an\\nunprecedented wave of enthusiasm. It can interact\\nwith humans through multiple turns of dialogue,\\nunderstand user intent, accomplish instructions and\\nreturn human-like responses. Shocked by Chat-\\nGPT’s performance, some papers already consider\\nGPT-4 as an early version of artificial general intel-\\nligence (AGI) (Altman, 2023; Bubeck et al., 2023).\\nInformation Extraction\\nAs a popular and funda-\\nmental task, information extraction (IE) aims to ex-\\ntract structured knowledge of interest from unstruc-\\ntured plain text. The output mainly includes enti-\\nties, relations between entities, event arguments,\\nopinions, human sentiments, etc. Due to the differ-\\nent target information, IE mainly involves 4 tasks,\\nincluding named entity recognition (NER) (Li et al.,\\n2020; Wang et al., 2021; Ding et al., 2021; Yang\\net al., 2023), relation extraction (RE) (Nan et al.,\\n2020; Zhao et al., 2021; Han et al., 2022; Zhan\\net al., 2022; Li et al., 2022; Peng et al., 2022; Wang\\net al., 2023b), event extraction (EE) (Lin et al.,\\n2020; Lee et al., 2021a; Hsu et al., 2022) and aspect-\\nbased sentiment analysis (ABSA) (Chen and Qian,\\n2020; Yan et al., 2021; Feng et al., 2021; Zhang\\net al., 2022c,b; Yu et al., 2023). Since the result of\\nIE directly affects the performance of subsequent\\nhigher-level applications, the importance of IE can-\\nnot be overstated. This paper intends to evaluate\\nthe performance of ChatGPT on IE, in detail.\\nEvaluation of ChatGPT\\nSince ChatGPT is a\\nclosed model and OpenAI does not provide its train-\\ning details, researchers are exploring its concerns\\nand capabilities. The concerns involve ethical risks\\n(Haque et al., 2022; Krügel et al., 2023), patient pri-\\nvacy (Tang et al., 2023), fabricated misinformation\\n(Jeblick et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023), education\\nintegrity (Malinka et al., 2023) and legal challenges\\n(Sun, 2023). For its capabilities, researchers evalu-\\nate the performance of ChatGPT on different tasks,\\nincluding stance detection (Zhang et al., 2022a),\\nquestion-answering (Guo et al., 2023), machine\\ntranslation (Jiao et al., 2023), sentiment analysis\\n(Susnjak, 2023) and other general NLP tasks (Qin\\net al., 2023; Zhong et al., 2023; Bian et al., 2023;\\nBang et al., 2023). In addition, for the informa-\\ntion extraction task, Wei et al. (2023) propose a\\ntwo-stage framework, ChatIE, to use ChatGPT for\\nzero-shot information extraction, and evaluate its\\nperformance in detail. Li et al. (2023) measure the\\nperformance, explainability, calibration and faith-\\nfulness of ChatGPT on IE tasks. As a concurrent\\nwork, this paper measures the performance of Chat-\\nGPT on multiple datasets of 14 IE subtasks, ex-\\nplores the impact of in-context learning (ICL) and\\nchain-of-thought (COT) prompts on performance,\\nevaluates robustness by scenario, and analyzes er-\\nror types. Our perspective is significantly different\\nfrom Li et al. (2023), and we evaluate more IE\\nsub-tasks on more benchmarks.\\n3\\nChatGPT for Information Extraction\\n3.1\\nTasks\\nIn this paper, we consider 4 well-representative IE\\ntasks, including Named Entity Recognition (NER),\\nRelation Extraction (RE), Event Extraction (EE)\\nand Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA).\\nSince each task contains several subtasks or sce-\\nnarios, we conduct evaluations and analysis on the\\nfollowing 14 sub-tasks:\\n• Flat Entity Recognition (NER-Flat): Recog-\\nnizing all entities within the text. Each entity\\nis identified as a separate entity, without any\\nhierarchical relationship between them.\\n• Nested Entity Recognition (NER-Nested):\\nRecognizing all entities within the text. Each\\nentity can be nested inside other entities, i.e.,\\nan entity may contain other sub-entities.\\n• Relation Classification (RE-RC): Determin-\\ning the relationship between a pair of given\\nentities within the text.\\n• Relational Triplet Extraction (RE-Triplet):\\nIdentifying entities and their relationships si-\\nmultaneously.\\n• Event Detection (EE-Trigger): Identifying the\\nword or phrase that indicates the occurrence of\\nan event, and categorizing its corresponding\\nevent type.\\n• Event Argument Extraction (EE-Argument):\\nRecognizing the entities that are involved in\\nthe given event, and classifying their corre-\\nsponding roles.\\n• Trigger-Argument joint Extraction (EE-Joint):\\nIdentifying event trigger, event type and all\\narguments with their roles simultaneously.\\n• Aspect Extraction (ABSA-AE): Extracting all\\nthe aspect terms from a review.\\n• Opinion Extraction (ABSA-OE): Extracting\\nall the opinion terms from a review.\\n• Aspect-level Sentiment Classification (ABSA-\\nALSC): Predicting the sentiment polarities for\\nevery given aspect terms in a review.\\n• Aspect-oriented Opinion Extraction (ABSA-\\nAOE): Extracting the paired opinion terms for\\nevery given aspect terms in a review.\\n• Aspect Extraction and Sentiment Classifica-\\ntion (ABSA-AESC): Extracting the aspect\\nterms as well as the corresponding sentiment\\npolarities simultaneously.\\n• Pair Extraction (ABSA-Pair): Extracting the\\naspect terms as well as the corresponding opin-\\nion terms simultaneously.\\n• Triplet Extraction (ABSA-Triplet): Extract-\\ning all aspects terms with their corresponding\\nopinion terms and sentiment polarity simulta-\\nneously.\\n3.2\\nDatasets\\nWe select at least four datasets for each IE task,\\nwith a total of 17 datasets as follows2:\\n• For NER task, the datasets include CoNLL03\\n(Sang and Meulder, 2003), FewNERD(Ding\\net al., 2021), ACE04(Doddington et al., 2004),\\nACE05-Ent(Walker et al., 2006) and GE-\\nNIA(Ohta et al., 2002).\\n• For RE task, the datasets include CoNLL04\\n(Roth and Yih, 2004), NYT-multi (Zeng et al.,\\n2018), TACRED (Zhang et al., 2017), Se-\\nmEval 2010 (Hendrickx et al., 2010).\\n• For EE task, the datasets include ACE05-Evt\\n(Walker et al., 2006), ACE05+ (Lin et al.,\\n2020), CASIE (Satyapanich et al., 2020) and\\nCommodity News EE (Lee et al., 2021b).\\n• For ABSA task, the datasets include D17\\n(Wang et al., 2017), D19 (Fan et al., 2019),\\nD20a (Peng et al., 2020) and D20b (Xu et al.,\\n2020), which are all originated from the Se-\\nmEval Challenges (Pontiki et al., 2014, 2015,\\n2016).\\n3.3\\nPrompts\\nThe prompts designed in this paper all consists of\\nfive main elements: the task instruction, candidate\\ntarget labels, output format description, demonstra-\\ntion examples and the input text. The task instruc-\\ntion describes the specific IE sub-task, candidate\\ntarget labels are the types of target information,\\nsuch as entity types, relation types, etc. The output\\nformat description specifies the format of outputs\\nto facilitate the distinguishing of target informa-\\ntion. The demonstration examples exist under the\\nfew-shot In-context Learning setting, which can\\nalso provide the chain-of-thought explanation. The\\n2We also conduct evaluations on additional datasets, see\\nthe Appendix B for results on more datasets.\\ninput text is a sentence of review from which tar-\\nget information is to be extracted. An example of\\nprompts for NER task is shown in Figure 1.\\nFor the demonstration examples, we randomly\\nselect them from the training set of each dataset\\nin Section 3.2.\\nTo obtain the chain-of-thought\\nprompts, we construct them manually with the help\\nof ChatGPT to generate explanations.\\n3.4\\nSetup\\nTo conduct a thorough evaluation of ChatGPT’s\\ncapabilities, for each IE sub-task, we first measure\\nthe performance of zero-shot scenario. Then, we\\ninvestigate the impact of few-shot in-context learn-\\ning (ICL) and few-shot chain-of-thought (COT)\\nprompting on the performance. Specifically, we\\nmanually design 5 different zero-shot prompts for\\neach sub-task since ChatGPT is sensitive to dif-\\nferent prompts, and report the mean and standard\\ndeviation values to alleviate the randomness of\\nprompts. To construct few-shot ICL prompts, we\\nselect the zero-shot prompt with best performance\\nand add the randomly selected samples from the\\ncorresponding training set.\\nFor few-shot COT\\nprompts, we add the chain-of-thought explanations\\nto the few-shot ICL prompts, where the chain-of-\\nthought explanations are manually constructed with\\nthe help of ChatGPT. To eliminate the randomness\\nof selected samples, we select five different groups\\nand also report the means and standard deviations.\\nWe use the official API to generate all outputs\\nfrom ChatGPT. To prevent the influence of dia-\\nlogue history, we generate the response separately\\nfor each testing sample. Unlike other work where\\nonly 30-50 samples are selected for evaluation(Jiao\\net al., 2023; Wei et al., 2023), we use the entire\\ntest set of most dataset in Section 3.2 for evalua-\\ntion. Too few samples will lead to low coverage\\nand high randomness of results, too many samples\\nare limited by the rate and expense of accessing\\nOpenAI’s API. Since most of datasets we use have\\na test set with less than 3000 samples, we limit\\nthe number of samples to a maximum of 3000 by\\nrandom sampling.\\nBesides, we compare ChatGPT with the state-\\nof-the-art result for each sub-task. For the metric,\\nwe use F1 metric for all sub-tasks. See the Ap-\\npendix A.1 for the F1 calculation criteria of all\\nsub-tasks.\\nAn example of NER task prompts\\nGiven the list of entity types [\"Organization\", \"Person\", \"Location\", \"Miscellaneous\"], read the given sentence and find out all words/phrases that indicate the\\nabove types of named entities. Answer in the format [\"entity_type\", \"entity_name\"] without any explanation. If no entity exists, then just answer \"[]\".\\nSentence: \"Japan began the defense of their Asian Cup title with a lucky 2-1 win against Syria in a Group C championship match on Friday.\"\\nAnswer: [\"Location\", \"Japan\"], [\"Miscellaneous\", \"Asian Cup\"], [\"Location\", \"Syria\"]\\n... (More examples are omitted here.)\\nSentence: \"In Home Health said it previously recorded a reserve equal to 16 percent of all revenue related to the community liaison costs.\"\\nAnswer:\\nExpected Output:\\n[\"Organization\", \"In Home Health\"]\\nFigure 1: An example of prompts for NER task on CoNLL03 dataset. See the Appendix C for more prompts.\\n4\\nThe Performance\\nIn this section, we report the performance of Chat-\\nGPT on 14 different sub-tasks, as shown in Table 1.\\n4.1\\nPerformance Gap in Zero-shot Scenario\\nFrom the zero-shot result of Table 1, we can draw\\nthe following conclusions: 1) There is a signifi-\\ncant performance gap between ChatGPT and\\nSOTA methods. This seems obvious and reason-\\nable, since all SOTA methods are trained on corre-\\nsponding datasets. In other words, they are fully\\nsupervised models and are not zero/few-shot ones.\\n2) The harder the task, the larger the perfor-\\nmance gap. From the perspective of the four IE\\ntasks of NER, RE, EE and ABSA, it can be seen\\nthat ABSA task perform significantly better than\\nRE and EE tasks. Almost all sub-tasks of ABSA\\ncan reach more than 50% of SOTA, while all sub-\\ntasks of RE and EE rarely exceed 30% of SOTA.\\nOne reason is that ABSA task involves only as-\\npect terms and opinion terms, and is much simpler.\\nWhile RE task and EE task involve many more\\ntarget types, and is much harder. Take NYT-multi\\ndataset for example, there are 24 relation types. 3)\\nThe harder the scenario, the larger the perfor-\\nmance gap. Each IE task has several scenarios.\\nFor NER task, the NER-Flat scenario is intuitively\\nsimpler than NER-Nested, and the performance of\\nNER-Flat is significantly better than NER-Nested\\n(47.0% vs. 26.7%). For other tasks, including RE,\\nEE and ABSA, we can observe similar results. 4)\\nOn a few simple cases, ChatGPT can equal or ex-\\nceed the performance of SOTA methods. We can\\nfind that ChatGPT is able to achieve comparable\\nperformance with SOTA methods on the ABSA-\\nALSC sub-task, and can even surpass SOTA result,\\nreaching 117.7% of SOTA. The sub-task is a simple\\nsentiment classification, and the candidate polari-\\nties include “positive”, “neutral” and “negative”.\\n4.2\\nMitigate the Gap\\nThe observed performance gap in the above sub-\\nsection is not consistent with our actual experience\\nwith ChatGPT. To mitigate the gap, we add few\\nrandomly selected demonstration examples to con-\\nstruct few-shot ICL prompts and few-shot COT\\nprompts. To eliminate the randomness of selected\\nexamples, we construct five groups of demonstra-\\ntion examples, and report the means and standard\\ndeviations in Figure 1.\\nFor the few-shot ICL setting, it can be seen that\\nusing few-shot ICL prompts generally leads to\\nsignificant improvements (about 3.0∼13.0 F1\\nvalue), but still obviously lags behind SOTA re-\\nsults. This seems to be inconsistent with the con-\\nclusion of Wadhwa et al. (2023) that ChatGPT can\\nachieve performance equivalent to SOTA methods\\nby providing some demonstration examples. One\\nreason may be that Wadhwa et al. (2023) provide\\nmore demonstration examples, i.e., almost 20 ex-\\namples, while we only provide 5 demonstration\\nexamples. So, with a smaller number of demonstra-\\ntion examples, the few-shot ICL prompts cannot\\nradically eliminate the performance gap.\\nFor the few-shot COT setting, we can find that\\nthe use of few-shot COT prompts cannot guar-\\nantee further gains compared to few-shot ICL\\nprompts, sometimes it is worse than the perfor-\\nmance of few-shot ICL prompts. The possible\\nreasons are that, the quality of constructed chain-of-\\nthought prompts is not good enough and ChatGPT\\nis too sensitive for the few-shot COT prompts.\\nTask\\nDataset\\nSOTA\\nZero-shot\\n5-shot ICL\\n5-shot COT\\nRatio@SOTA\\nmax\\nmean (std)\\nmean (std)\\nmean (std)\\nABSA-AE\\nD17-14lap\\n85.3(Lv et al., 2023)\\n47.11\\n43.03

Follow-\\ning the evaluation method of previous work (Lu\\net al., 2022; Lou et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), we\\nstrictly match the start and end indices of the pre-\\ndicted target text span (e.g., entity spans, opinion\\nspans). This method may not be suitable for the\\nevaluation of LLMs like ChatGPT that generate\\nhuman-like responses.\\nType\\nAnnotated Spans\\nPredicted Spans\\nEntity\\nPGA Europro Tour\\n2021 PGA Europro Tour\\nUniversity of Michigan\\nThe University of Michigan\\nAustralia\\nWestern Australia\\nEvent Trigger\\nwar\\nmove toward war\\nfighting\\ncommit fighting forces\\nkilled\\nmarines killed\\nAspect Term\\nUSB ports\\nmultiple USB ports\\napplication\\napplication crash\\ncable\\nextender cable\\nOpinion Term\\nfast\\nsuper fast\\nwell worth\\nwell worth it\\nnot handle\\ndoes not handle\\nTable 2: The selected annotated spans and their corre-\\nsponding predicted spans.\\nWe manually check ChatGPT’s responses, and\\nfind that ChatGPT tends to identify longer spans\\nthan the annotated ones, to get closer to humans.\\nAll sub-tasks in Section 3.1 involve four types of\\nspan: entities, event triggers, aspect terms and opin-\\nion terms. For each type of span, we select several\\ntypical annotated spans and their corresponding\\npredicted spans, and shown them in Table 2. It\\ncan be seen that the annotated spans usually do\\nnot contain qualifiers such as quantifiers, articles,\\nadjectives, time, place, etc. While the spans pre-\\ndicted by ChatGPT usually contain these quali-\\nfier parts, which are also correct target informa-\\ntion. For example, “University of Michigan” and\\n“The University of Michigan” indicate the same tar-\\nget information, although the offsets are different.\\nTherefore, to incorporate this case, we propose a\\nsoft-matching approach to obtain more accurate\\nevaluation results, as shown in Algorithm 1. Where\\nGetSimilarity(·) indicates a method to calculate\\nthe similarity, here we use the python package dif-\\nflib to calculate the edit distance as the similarity\\nAlgorithm 1 Soft-Matching Strategy\\nInput: the sentence s, the list of annotated spans\\nLA in sentence s, a predicted span p, the similarity\\nthreshold γ.\\nOutput: Return True if just the offsets of two\\nspans are different and the similarity is greater than\\nγ, otherwise return False.\\nBegin:\\n0.

Note that the Line 6 in the algorithm ensures\\nthat only the offsets of spans are different.\\nWe compare the evaluation results between\\nthe default hard-matching strategy and the soft-\\nmatching strategy for related sub-tasks, and show\\nthem in Table 3. For space reasons, we only report\\nresults of one dataset for each sub-tasks. We set\\nthe threshold γ to 0.5. See the Appendix A.2 for\\nthe threshold value’s details. From the Table 3, it\\ncan be seen that the soft-matching strategy deliv-\\ners consistent and significant performance gains,\\nwith up to 14.53 F1 value. Interestingly, the im-\\nprovement on simple sub-tasks is much more no-\\nticeable, i.e., ABSA task has a higher overall per-\\nformance gains than EE task. Further, although the\\nsoft-matching strategy brings significant gains, it\\ndoes not reach a comparable level with SOTA meth-\\nods. This is still consistent with the conclusions of\\nSection 4.\\n6\\nRobustness Analysis\\n6.1\\nInvalid Output\\nSince ChatGPT is a generative model, the output\\nresponses may be irrelevant information that does\\nnot meet the task requirements. In this subsection,\\nwe investigate how many invalid responses Chat-\\nGPT returns for different IE tasks.

The specific implementation is to modify\\nthe “input text” part of zero-shot prompts, by ran-\\ndomly inserting a piece of irrelevant text before\\nand after the input text. The irrelevant text does\\nnot contain the target information spans to be ex-\\ntracted. We also select the same dataset for each\\nsub-task as Table 3, report the mean values of 5 dif-\\nferent zero-shot prompts and performance changes,\\nshown in Table 5. It can be seen that the perfor-\\nmance of most sub-tasks decreases significantly, up\\nto 48.0%, when adding irrelevant context randomly.\\nThe ABSA-ALSC and RE-RC sub-tasks have less\\nperformance drop, due to the fact that they perform\\nclassification based on the given aspect term or en-\\ntity pair and are less affected by irrelevant context.\\nWe can conclude that ChatGPT is very sensitive\\nto the irrelevant context, which can significantly\\ndegrade performance on IE tasks.\\nTask\\nDataset\\nNo-Irrel.\\nWith-Irrel.\\n∆F1 (%)\\nABSA-AE\\nD17-14lap\\n43.03\\n25.88\\n17.15 (39.9%)\\nABSA-OE\\nD17-14lap\\n48.45\\n27.36\\n21.09 (43.5%)\\nABSA-ALSC\\nD17-14lap\\n74.56\\n67.89\\n6.67 ( 8.9%)\\nABSA-AOE\\nD19-14lap\\n57.60\\n46.24\\n11.36 (19.7%)\\nABSA-AESC\\nD20a-14lap\\n45.48\\n29.88\\n15.60 (34.3%)\\nABSA-Pair\\nD20a-14lap\\n31.76\\n16.51\\n15.25 (48.0%)\\nABSA-Triplet\\nD20b-14lap\\n33.17\\n19.63\\n13.54 (40.7%)\\nNER-Flat\\nCoNLL03\\n60.10\\n46.09\\n14.01 (23.3%)\\nNER-Nested\\nACE05-Ent\\n23.38\\n19.65\\n3.73 (16.0%)\\nRE-RC\\nSemEval2010\\n39.27\\n37.94\\n1.33 (3.4%)\\nRE-Triplet\\nCoNLL04\\n17.84\\n11.40\\n6.44 (36.1%)\\nEE-Trigger\\nACE05-Evt\\n17.55\\n12.01\\n5.54 (31.6%)\\nEE-Argument\\nACE05-Evt\\n25.09\\n20.42\\n4.67 (18.6%)\\nEE-Joint\\nACE05-Evt\\n8.74\\n5.25\\n3.49 (39.9%)\\nTable 5: Performance of all IE sub-tasks under the set-\\nting with irrelevant context. “No-Irrel.” indicates the\\ndefault zero-shot result in Table 1, while “With-Irrel.”\\ndenotes the results with irrelevant contexts.\\n6.3\\nFrequency of Target Types\\nThe real-world data usually exhibits a long-tailed\\ndistribution, i.e., the frequency of target types\\nvaries greatly, causing the models to perform much\\nworse on uncommon/tail types than on common/-\\nhead ones. Here target types include entity types,\\nrelation types, event types, etc. In this subsection,\\nwe investigate the impact of the “frequency of tar-\\nget types” on ChatGPT’s performance on all IE\\nsub-tasks. We select one dataset for each sub-task\\nwith the phenomenon of frequency differences, re-\\nport the mean values of five different prompts on\\nthe head types and tail types under the zero-shot\\nsetting. See the Appendix A.3 for details on how\\nto distinguish head types and tail ones for each sub-\\ntask. The results are shown in Table 6. It can be\\nseen that the performance of tail types is signifi-\\ncantly worse than head types, only up to 75.9%\\nperformance of head types. On some sub-tasks,\\nsuch as RE-RC and RE-Triplet, the performance\\nof tail types is even lower than 15% of head types’\\nperformance. We can conclude that ChatGPT also\\nsuffers from the long-tail problem.\\nTask\\nDataset\\nHead\\nTail\\nRatio (%)\\nNER-Flat\\nFewNERD\\n34.59\\n20.82\\n60.2%\\nNER-Nested\\nACE05-Ent\\n26.57\\n7.79\\n29.3%\\nRE-RC\\nNYT-multi\\n34.71\\n3.74\\n10.8%\\nRE-Triplet\\nNYT-multi\\n4.34\\n0.21\\n4.8%\\nEE-Trigger\\nACE05-Evt\\n19.10\\n14.49\\n75.9%\\nEE-Joint\\nACE05-Evt\\n9.48\\n5.98\\n63.1%\\nTable 6: Performance comparison of ChatGPT between\\nhead and tail types for each IE sub-task.

Since most relation types\\nare not symmetric, the order of two entities is very\\ncritical. For example, the sentence “Steven Paul\\nJobs was born in San Francisco on February 24,\\n1955.” expresses the relational triplet <Steven Paul\\nJobs, born_in, San Francisco>, not the triplet <San\\nFrancisco, born_in, Steven Paul Jobs>. For each\\ninstance of the asymmetric relation types, we swap\\nthe order of entities and check the change in pre-\\ndiction results. After exchanging the order, the pre-\\ndiction result should be changed to “NA”, which\\nindicates no relationship exists between entities.\\nThe results are shown in Table 7. All values are\\nthe mean using five different zero-shot prompts.\\nWe can see that after swapping the order, most of\\npredicted results (over 70%) remain the same as be-\\nfore the swap. Therefore, it can be concluded that\\nFor RE-RC sub-task, ChatGPT is not sensitive\\nto the order of entities, and cannot accurately\\nunderstand the subject-object relationship of\\nentities.\\nError Type\\n#Error.\\nRatio (%)\\nMissing spans\\n2979\\n15.4%\\nUnmentioned spans\\n284\\n1.5%\\nUnannotated spans\\n6361\\n32.9%\\nIncorrect span offsets\\n1744\\n9.0%\\nUndefined types\\n883\\n4.6%\\nIncorrect types\\n4296\\n22.2%\\nOther\\n2801\\n14.4%\\nTotal\\n19348\\n100%\\nTable 8: Statistical analysis of various error types for\\nNER-Flat sub-task on the CoNLL03 dataset. “#Error.”\\nindicates the occurrence number of corresponding er-\\nror type, while “Ratio (%)” denotes the corresponding\\npercentage.\\n7\\nAnalysis of Error Types\\nIn this section, we analyze ChatGPT’s errors on\\nall IE sub-tasks. Here we use “span” to denote\\nthe target information to be extracted, and “types”\\nto indicate the types of target information such as\\nentity types, relation type, event types, sentiment\\npolarity, etc. Through the manual checking, we\\nfind that the errors mainly include:\\n• Missing spans: Missing one or more anno-\\ntated target spans.\\n• Unmentioned spans: Answering the spans\\nthat do not exist within the given input text.\\n• Unannotated spans: Answering the spans\\nthat are not annotated in the test set.\\n• Incorrect span offsets: The offsets of the\\nanswered spans are incorrect.\\n• Undefined types: Answering the types be-\\nyond the pre-defined types when the corre-\\nsponding span is correct.\\n• Incorrect types: The answered span is cor-\\nrect, while the corresponding type comes from\\nthe set of pre-defined types, but does not\\nmatch the annotated type.\\n• Other: Other errors apart from the above er-\\nrors, such as incorrect output format, answer-\\ning unexpected information, etc.\\nSince these error types are suitable for all sub-\\ntasks in Section 3.1, for convenience, we take\\n15.40%\\n1.50%\\n32.90%\\n9.00%\\n4.60%\\n22.20%\\n14.40%\\nError T\\nypes\\nMissing spans\\nUnmentioned spans\\nUnannotated spans\\nIncorrect span offsets\\nUndefined types\\nIncorrect types\\nOther\\nFigure 2: Percentage of error types for NER-Flat sub-\\ntask on the CoNLL03 dataset.\\nthe NER-Flat as an example, and statistically an-\\nalyze each type of above errors under the zero-\\nshot setting, on the CoNLL03 dataset. The re-\\nsults are shown in Table 8 and Figure 2. It can\\nbe seen that “Unannotated spans”, “Incorrect\\ntypes” and “Missing spans” are the three main\\ntypes of errors, accounting for more than 70%.\\nIn particular, nearly 1/3 of all errors is the error\\nof unannotated spans, which also raises concerns\\nabout the quality if annotated data.\\n8\\nConclusion\\nIn this paper, we assess the capabilities of Chat-\\nGPT from four perspectives including Performance,\\nEvaluation Criteria, Robustness and Error Types.\\nThe details and conclusions are as follows:\\nPerformance\\nwe first evaluate ChatGPT’s per-\\nformance on 17 datasets with 14 IE sub-tasks under\\nthe zero-shot, few-shot and chain-of-thought sce-\\nnarios, and find a huge performance gap between\\nChatGPT and SOTA results.\\nEvaluation Criteria\\nWe rethink the performance\\ngap and find that the span hard-matching strategy\\nis not suitable for the evaluation of ChatGPT, due\\nto ChatGPT generate human-like responses. We\\npropose a soft-matching strategy for evaluation to\\nmore accurately reflect ChatGPT’s performance.\\nRobustness\\nWe analyze the robustness of Chat-\\nGPT on 14 IE sub-tasks from four perspective,\\nincluding invalid output, irrelevant context, fre-\\nquency of target types and error types. We draw\\nthe following conclusions: 1) ChatGPT rarely out-\\nputs invalid responses; 2) Irrelevant context and\\nlong-tail target types greatly affect ChatGPT’s per-\\nformance; 3) ChatGPT cannot understand well the\\nsubject-object relationships in RE task.\\nError Types\\nThrough the manual checking, we\\nanalyze the errors of ChatGPT and summarize 7\\ntypes of errors, including Missing spans, Unmen-\\ntioned spans, Unannotated spans, Incorrect span\\noffsets, Undefined types, Incorrect types and Other.\\nWe find that “Unannotated spans” is the most dom-\\ninant error type. This raises concerns about the\\nquality of previous annotated data, and indicates\\nthe possibility of annotating data with ChatGPT.\\nReferences\\nSam Altman. 2023. Planning for agi and beyond.

A\\ncomparative study on chatgpt and fine-tuned BERT.\\nCoRR, abs/2302.10198.\\nA\\nDetails of Other Settings\\nA.1\\nMetric and Evaluation Criteria\\nWe use Micro-F1 as the primary metric to evaluate\\nChatGPT’s performance on different IE sub-tasks:\\n• Flat-NER, Nested-NER: A predicted entity\\nis correct if its offsets and type match a refer-\\nence entity.\\n• RE-RC: A predicted relation is correct if its\\nrelation type matches the reference type.\\n• RE-Triplet: A predicted relational triplet is\\ncorrect if its relation type is correct and the\\nsubject and object entity spans are all cor-\\nrect. We only report the F1 value of relational\\ntriplets.\\n• EE-Trigger: A predicted event trigger is cor-\\nrect if its span and event type all match the\\nreference trigger.\\n• EE-Argument: For a given event type, a pre-\\ndicted argument is correct if its span and role\\ntype all match the reference argument mention\\nof this event.\\n• EE-Joint: A predicted argument is correct if\\nits span, role type and event type all match the\\nreference argument mention. We only report\\nthe F1 value of event arguments.\\n• ABSA-AE, ASBA-OE: An aspect/opinion is\\ncorrect if its span matches the reference aspec-\\nt/opinion mention.\\n• ABSA-ALSC: A sentiment polarity is correct\\nif it matches the reference polarity of given\\naspect term.\\n• ABSA-AOE: An opinion is correct if its span\\nmatches the reference opinion of given aspect\\nterm.\\n• ABSA-AESC: An aspect-sentiment pair is\\ncorrect if its aspect span and corresponding\\nsentiment polarity are all correct.\\n• ABSA-Pair: An aspect-opinion pair is correct\\nif its aspect span and opinion span all match\\nthe reference pair.\\n• ABSA-Triplet: A triplet is correct if its as-\\npect span, opinion span and corresponding\\nsentiment polarity are all correct.\\nDataset\\nK\\n#Head\\n#Tail\\nFewNERD\\n2000\\n46\\n20\\nACE05-Ent\\n1000\\n3\\n4\\nNYT-multi\\n500\\n11\\n13\\nACE05-Evt\\n50\\n19\\n14\\nTable 9: The threshold (K), number of head types\\n(#Head) and number of tail types (#Tail) on different\\ndatasets.\\nA.2\\nAdditional Notes on Soft-Matching\\nStrategy\\nThe similarity calculated by our soft-matching strat-\\negy takes the value from 0 and 1. For the threshold\\nγ, we set it to 0.5 by default, since this process can\\nbe seen as the binary classification problem. We\\nassume that When the predicted span and the\\nannotated span are only different in offset, the\\npredicted span is reasonable and meaningful if\\nthe similarity value is higher than 0.5.\\nA.3\\nAdditional Notes on Head/Tail Target\\nTypes\\nThe head types are those with more than K train-\\ning instances in the training set, while tail types\\nare those with less than K training instances. Take\\nthe entity type “Person” as an example, if the num-\\nber of “Person” entities in the training set is more\\nthan the threshold K, then “Person” is a head type,\\nand vice versa, it is a tail type. The values of K,\\ncorresponding to the datasets used in Section 6.3,\\nare shown in the Table 9. Since the ABSA task\\ninvolves only two types of entities, i.e., aspect term\\nand opinion term, there is no long-tail types.\\nB\\nResults on More Datasets\\nIn this section, we report the results on more\\ndatasets for all 14 sub-tasks in Section 3.1. Under\\nthe zero-shot, few-shot and chain-of-thought sce-\\nnarios, we design five different prompts and shown\\nthe corresponding maximum, minimum, mean and\\nstandard deviation, respectively.\\nC\\nInput Examples\\nFor demonstration, we show the zero-shot prompts,\\nfew-shot ICL prompts and few-shot COT prompts\\nof NER task on the CoNLL03 dataset.

Unlike conven-\\ntional search engines, ChatGPT retrieves knowledge from\\nthe model itself and generates answers for users. ChatGPT’s\\nquestion-answering (QA) process typically flows smoothly\\nlike a natural chat, enhancing the user experience and en-\\ncouraging the general public to migrate to it. By January\\n2023, ChatGPT has crossed the 100-million-user milestone,\\nmaking it the fastest-growing platform in history [1].\\nGiven the enormous usage, i.e., 1 billion queries per\\nday [1], ChatGPT has raised concerns about its question-\\nanswering reliability in generic knowledge domains, e.g.,\\nscience, technology, law, medicine, etc. These concerns are\\nfurther compounded by the fact that ChatGPT’s proficiency\\nin articulating rich answers may foster trust among ordinary\\nusers who often lack the expertise or are negligent to iden-\\ntify mistakes in the model’s responses [59]. For instance, in\\nMay 2023, a lawyer used ChatGPT to retrieve legal cases for\\na brief against the Colombian airline Avianca. However, it\\nwas subsequently revealed that these cases did not exist, re-\\nsulting in sanctions on the lawyer [72]. Similarly, in April\\n2023, when asked to generate a list of legal scholars involved\\nin sexual harassment incidents, ChatGPT fabricated a sexual\\nharassment scandal involving a real professor [68]. These\\ninstances of ChatGPT’s unreliability extend beyond individ-\\nual incidents, as they can have far-reaching consequences for\\nlegal proceedings, reputation damage, and the spread of mis-\\ninformation.\\nThere exists some preliminary research evaluating the effi-\\ncacy of ChatGPT on question-answering [12,76]. However,\\nthey either use only limited samples or concentrate on ques-\\ntions of certain types or from certain QA datasets. While\\nthese evaluations provide valuable insights into ChatGPT’s\\ncapabilities, they may not fully reflect the diversity and com-\\nplexity of questions that ChatGPT could face.\\nMoreover,\\nChatGPT allows users to steer its behaviors by describing\\ndirections via system role [3], such as “you are a helpful\\nassistant.” While multiple system roles have been widely\\ndiscussed in the user community [2, 10, 61] and integrated\\ninto various applications [5, 6, 9], a systematic investigation\\ninto the impact of these system roles on ChatGPT’s reliabil-\\nity is still lacking. In addition, due to ChatGPT’s popularity,\\nit is inevitable that malicious users will, if not already, at-\\ntack ChatGPT with adversarial examples. It remains unclear\\nwhether such attacks are indeed feasible.\\nResearch Questions. To address the above issues, in this\\npaper, we measure ChatGPT’s reliability in generic question-\\nanswering (QA) scenarios from following three perspectives.\\n1. RQ1: Is ChatGPT reliable in generic QA scenarios?\\n2. RQ2: Do system roles impact ChatGPT’s reliability?\\n3. RQ3: Can ChatGPT respond reliably when facing ad-\\nversarial examples?\\nEvaluation Framework. To quantitatively evaluate Chat-\\nGPT’s reliability in the generic question-answering use\\ncases, we build an evaluation framework consisting of\\ntwo main steps: 1) establishing a representative evaluation\\ndataset and 2) assessing answers from ChatGPT (see Sec-\\ntion 3). Concretely, we collect ten QA datasets across four\\n1\\narXiv:2304.08979v2  [cs.CR]  5 Oct 2023\\nanswer types, i.e., yes/no (YN), multiple-choice (MC), ex-\\ntractive (EX), and abstractive (AB). We leverage thematic\\nanalysis to align them to a unified dataset, resulting in 5,695\\nquestions across eight question domains, including history,\\nlaw, general works, medicine, social science, science, tech-\\nnology, and recreation.\\nWe evaluate ChatGPT’s reliabil-\\nity through two perspectives: correctness and unanswerable\\nquestion identification. Our rationale is that, when answer-\\ning questions, ChatGPT should not only provide correct an-\\nswers (correctness) but can identify situations where no an-\\nswer should be provided (unanswerable question detection)\\nas well. The latter capability is especially critical in sensi-\\ntive domains such as law and medicine, as the inquirer often\\nlacks the expertise to discern errors among answers [59]. We\\nalso conduct qualitative analysis to understand why ChatGPT\\nfails to answer some questions or refuses to answer them.\\nIs ChatGPT Reliable in Generic Question-Answering\\nScenarios. We observe ChatGPT exhibits varying levels of\\nreliability in different domains. While ChatGPT shows rela-\\ntively high correctness in the recreation and technology ques-\\ntions, it underperforms in law and science domains. For ex-\\nample, the correctness of law questions on EX and AB tasks\\nis respectively 11.97% and 4.29% lower than the overall av-\\nerage correctness. ChatGPT’s ability to identify unanswer-\\nable questions is also limited. On GPT-3.5, it achieves a\\nrate of only 26.63%, and on GPT-4, the rate is even lower\\n(14.29%).\\nThese findings indicate that, when faced with\\nunanswerable questions, ChatGPT is prone to make mean-\\ningless guesses instead of rejecting the questions outright.\\nThrough qualitative analysis, we identify four failure rea-\\nsons and four refusal reasons used by ChatGPT. Interestingly,\\nChatGPT tends to use the reason “not mentioned” to reject\\nto answer. We have confirmed similar behavior of ChatGPT\\non both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models, suggesting that relying\\nsolely on model iteration is insufficient to solve reliability\\nissues.\\nDo System Roles Impact ChatGPT’s Reliability. We find\\nthat system roles may directly affect ChatGPT’s reliability.\\nFor instance, benign roles (Assistant, Expert, Expert-CoT,\\nand Expert-R) improve ChatGPT’s correctness on four QA\\ntasks, while bad and jailbreak roles generally reduce Chat-\\nGPT’s correctness and force it to select meaningless answers\\nto unanswerable questions. However, their impact is not al-\\nways evident from the role description alone. For instance,\\na jailbreak role may aim to circumvent restrictions but ulti-\\nmately result in decreased reliability. Our finding, for the first\\ntime, reveals how system roles can impact ChatGPT’s relia-\\nbility in an imperceptible way. We, therefore, emphasize the\\nimportance of evaluating a system role before applying it to\\nChatGPT.\\nCan ChatGPT Respond Reliably When Facing Adversar-\\nial Examples. Given the growing popularity of ChatGPT,\\nit is inevitable that malicious users will, if not already, at-\\ntack ChatGPT by carefully crafting adversarial examples as\\nits input.\\nIt is essential for ChatGPT to respond reliably\\nto these adversarial examples. Therefore, we also measure\\nChatGPT’s reliability against adversarial examples. We im-\\nplement five decision-based adversarial attacks with three\\nlevels of perturbations. We discover that ChatGPT is highly\\nvulnerable to sentence-level and character-level adversarial\\nattacks.\\nWe further manually engineer a prompt, namely\\nleakage prompt, to induce ChatGPT to disclose the confi-\\ndence scores. This enables us to implement score-based at-\\ntacks against ChatGPT and brings an average attack success\\nrate improvement of 0.38. Our qualitative analysis of the\\nadversarial examples identifies certain interesting cases like\\nchanging only one character is sufficient enough to alter the\\noutput of ChatGPT. These results demonstrate the vulnerabil-\\nity of ChatGPT to adversarial examples, highlighting the po-\\ntential safety/security risks associated with ChatGPT in prac-\\ntical applications.\\nOur Contributions. The contributions of the paper are as\\nsummarized as follows:\\n• We perform the first large-scale measurement of Chat-\\nGPT’s reliability in the generic QA scenario with a care-\\nfully curated set of 5,695 questions across ten datasets\\nand eight domains. Our results suggest ChatGPT’s reli-\\nability varies among different domains. We also reveal\\nthe deficiency of ChatGPT in identifying unanswerable\\nquestions, which suggests that ChatGPT tends to make\\nmeaningless guesses rather than reject answers when\\nserving unanswerable questions.\\n• We then, for the first time, systematically investigate the\\nimpacts of system roles on ChatGPT’s reliability. Sur-\\nprisingly, we find system roles can impact ChatGPT’s\\nreliability in an imperceptible way. This emphasizes the\\nimportance of evaluating a system role before applying\\nit to ChatGPT.\\n• We also assess ChatGPT’s reliability against adversarial\\nattacks. Our results show that ChatGPT is vulnerable to\\nsentence-level and character-level adversarial examples,\\nhighlighting the potential security risks associated with\\nChatGPT.\\n2\\nBackground\\n2.1\\nChatGPT\\nChatGPT is an advanced large language model (LLM) that\\nwas launched by OpenAI in November 2022. Based on the\\nenormous amount of knowledge it has learned during train-\\ning, ChatGPT can generate human-like responses to a wide\\nrange of prompts and questions [65]. Currently, the most\\nwidely used version of ChatGPT is based on the GPT-3.5\\narchitecture [23]. Access to ChatGPT on the GPT-4 model\\nis still limited and requires specific approval from OpenAI.\\nMoreover, ChatGPT allows users to define their task style by\\ndescribing those directions via roles, which are termed sys-\\ntem role by OpenAI. For example, users can write a prompt\\nstarting with “You are a helpful assistant”1 to direct Chat-\\nGPT to behave as an assistant.\\nUsers can also craft cer-\\ntain jailbreak messages, such as “You are going to pretend\\nto be DAN which stands for doing anything now” to get\\n1This is the officially recommended system role for ChatGPT.\\n2\\nTable 1: Four common QA tasks.\\nYes/NO QA (YN)\\nContext\\nA Long Island Iced Tea is a type of ...\\nQuestion\\nDo long island iced teas have tea in them?\\nAnswer\\nFALSE\\nMultiple-choice QA (MC)\\nContext\\nYou change the channels for the fourth time ...\\nQuestion\\nWhat is the most important for runners in a race?\\nOptions\\n(A) Having fun.

While Chat-\\nGPT instructed within the system roles has been increas-\\ningly used [2, 10, 61] and integrated into various applica-\\ntions [5,6,9], a systematic investigation of the effect of these\\nsystem roles is still lacking.\\n2.2\\nQuestion-Answering Task\\nQuestion-Answering (QA) is one of the main tasks in\\nNLP [26, 70].\\nGiven questions (and the context if any),\\nQA tasks evaluate a model’s capability in reading compre-\\nhension [24, 59, 60], information retrieval [36], logical rea-\\nsoning [74], and knowledge base [73].\\nBased on the an-\\nswer types, QA tasks can be generally categorized into four\\ntypes [41], i.e., yes/no [24], multiple-choice [25, 46, 51, 67],\\nextractive [59,60], and abstractive tasks [28,42,50] (see Ta-\\nble 1 for details). The yes/no task expects a simple “yes”\\nor “no” response, while the multiple-choice task requires the\\nmodel to select the correct answer from a set of given an-\\nswer candidates. The extractive task requires the model to\\nextract the answer from the context, and the abstractive task\\ndemands a free-form response from the model. Each of the\\nfour QA tasks elicits the model’s capability distinctively and\\nis evaluated with specific metrics; therefore, none of them\\ncan be easily substituted with one another. We refer the audi-\\nence to [63] for the overview of QA techniques and datasets.\\n3\\nEvaluation Framework\\n3.1\\nEvaluation Dataset\\nQA Datasets. We employ 10 widely used benchmark QA\\ndatasets in our study, including BoolQ [24], OpenbookQA\\n(OQA) [51], RACE [46], ARC [25], CommonsenseQA\\n(CQA) [67], SQuAD1 [60], SQuAD2 [59], NarrativeQA\\n(NQA) [42], ELI5 [28], and TruthfulQA (TQA) [50]. These\\ndatasets encompass a broad range of QA capabilities, such\\nas reading comprehension (BoolQ, SQuDA1/2, RACE), rea-\\nsoning (OQA, ARC), commonsense (CQA), full document\\ncomprehension (NQA, ELI5), and truthfulness (TQA). Fur-\\nthermore, they cover all four QA tasks [41], including yes/no\\n(BoolQ), multiple-choice (OQA, RACE, ARC, CQA), ex-\\ntractive (SQuAD 1/2), and abstractive tasks (NQA, ELI5,\\nTQA). They thus offer a solid foundation to comprehensively\\nevaluate the ChatGPT’s reliability in various real-world QA\\nscenarios. Their details are summarized in Table 2 and de-\\ntailed in Section A.1 in the Appendix.\\nQA Dataset Sampling. Our initial dataset comprises the\\nvalidation and test sets of each QA dataset.\\n1k records\\n(question-answering pairs) are randomly sampled from\\ndatasets whose validation set (or test set if the ground-truth\\nlabel is offered) contains over 2,000 question-answering\\npairs. Otherwise, the complete dataset is retained. Note,\\nRACE consists of two subsets, RACE-M from middle school\\nexams and RACE-H from high school exams, respectively.\\nFor each subset, we extract 1,000 records from its valida-\\ntion set, resulting in a total of 2,000 records from the RACE\\ndataset. This sampling method is motivated by three fac-\\ntors. First, we conduct a thematic analysis to group records\\ninto semantically similar domains. Given the necessity of hu-\\nman inspection, a smaller dataset is more practical. Second,\\ndata imbalance issues can be addressed to a certain extent\\nthrough this sampling method. For example, OQA and ARC\\nconcentrate on science and neglect other areas, such as law\\nand history. Consequently, more data from underrepresented\\ndomains can be obtained. Finally, due to ChatGPT API’s\\nslow response time of 10-20 seconds per query, evaluating\\nall records is impractical.\\nThematic Analysis. We then perform thematic analysis [17]\\nto pre-process the collected samples. The primary objective\\nof thematic analysis is to categorize the samples based on\\ntheir similarity in terms of semantics and domains, thereby\\nfacilitating meaningful and in-depth comparisons.\\nTo achieve this, we leverage BERTopic [32] to automat-\\nically topic modeling questions and then apply deductive\\nanalysis to assign these topics into broad domains. We test\\nfive pre-trained embedding models for BERTopic and choose\\nthe one with the highest CV coherence score (0.67) [62],\\nwhich is GTR-T5-XL. To address the potential misclassifi-\\ncations from the topic modeling method, we utilize the rep-\\nresentative score, which is the probability that a question be-\\nlongs to a specific topic, and empirically set the threshold at\\n0.5. Questions below this threshold are considered unclearly\\nclassified and subsequently filtered out. In the end, we ob-\\ntain 219 topics and 5,695 questions, out of which 410 ques-\\ntions are unanswerable. With manual inspection, we find the\\nresults are clustered by topics, e.g., Super Bowl, Sherlock\\nHolmes story, and so on. We then utilize a priori coding, a\\ncommon deductive approach in HCI, psychology, and usable\\nsecurity that categorize data samples with the guide of estab-\\nlished taxonomies or hypotheses [17, 29, 33, 47]. We refer\\nto the Library of Congress Classification [20] as our taxon-\\n3\\nTable 2: Statistics of QA datasets included in our testbed: one yes/no, four multiple-choice, two extractives, and three abstractive\\ndatasets. “idk” denotes unanswerable questions (e.g., 356 out of 698 questions from SQuAD2 are unanswerable).\\nQA Task\\nYes/NO QA (YN)\\nMultiple-choice QA (MC)\\nExtractive QA (EX)\\nAbstractive QA (AB)\\nDatasets\\nBoolQ\\nOQA\\nRACE\\nARC\\nCQA\\nSQuAD1\\nSQuAD2\\nNQA\\nELI5\\nTQA\\nHas context?\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n# of questions\\n1000\\n500\\n2000\\n869\\n1221\\n1000\\n1000\\n1000\\n1000\\n817\\n# of filtered questions\\n487\\n250\\n984\\n414\\n600\\n710\\n698\\n747\\n413\\n390\\n# of idk questions\\n356\\n54\\nEvaluation metric\\nAcc\\nAcc\\nF1\\nRougeL\\nData\\nSampling\\nThematic\\nAnalysis\\nTestbed\\n❶\\xa0Dataset\\xa0\\n❷\\xa0Pipeline\\n(a) Query Formation\\n(b)\\xa0ChatGPT Invocation\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\"The answer\\xa0 ...\"\\nAcc\\nYN\\nMC\\nEX\\nAB\\nTrue\\n(A)\\n\"Cola\"\\n\"...\"\\nAcc\\nF1\\nRougeL\\n(c) Answer\\nExtraction\\xa0\\nQuestion Context Options\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\"You are ...\"\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\"I will provide ...\"\\nUser\\nSystem\\n(d)\\xa0\\nEvaluation\\nFigure 1: Workflow of the evaluation framework.\\nomy as well as initial codes.

The final codebook (Table 9 in the Appendix)\\nincludes eight codes/domains namely history, law, general\\nworks, medicine, social science, science, technology, and\\nrecreation.

Our results show a\\ngood inter-coder agreement (kappa = 0.74).\\nFigure 2 shows the Sankey diagram of our testbed. We rec-\\nognize that datasets are often collected from a single source\\nand involved various domains. For example, SQuAD1’s data\\nsource is Wikipedia, but the questions cover eight domains.\\nTherefore, thematic analysis enables us to better assess Chat-\\nGPT’s capability across different data sources, datasets, an-\\nswer types, and question domains.\\nNote. We acknowledge that certain domains, such as law,\\nmedicine, and technology, may be underrepresented in our\\nstudy. This may be attributed to the a priori coding proce-\\ndure, in which we have refrained from merging these three\\ndomains into a broader domain as we have done with other\\ndomains. For example, the recreation domain is derived from\\nmusic, fine arts, literature, and movies (see Table 9 in the\\nAppendix). Nevertheless, we ensure that each domain is ade-\\nquately represented in our study, with the technology domain\\ncontaining the least number of questions at 165.\\n3.2\\nEvaluation Pipeline\\nOverview. Our evaluation pipeline consists of four steps,\\nincluding query formation, ChatGPT invocation, answer ex-\\ntraction, and evaluation.

The first column represents the data source, the sec-\\nond column refers to the dataset, and the last column displays\\nquestion domains. The thickness of each edge corresponds to\\nthe number of questions.\\nQuery Formation. A complete query to ChatGPT includes\\ntwo messages: a system message that sets the system role\\n(see Section 2.1) and a user message that asks the question.\\nFor system message, we leave the system message blank to\\naccess the native ChatGPT in RQ1 (Section 4) and explore\\nhow different system roles affect ChatGPT’s reliability in\\nRQ2 (Section 5). For user message, we use prompts adopted\\nfrom [2, 43] to instruct ChatGPT to provide answers in the\\nrequired format for different QA tasks. Concretely, we en-\\ncapsulate the prompt with the question and necessary infor-\\nmation, e.g., context and options, as the user message. The\\nprompts of each QA task are presented in Table 8 in the Ap-\\npendix. Note that we do not consider advanced techniques\\nsuch as in-context learning [53] to construct our queries, as\\nthese methods may not be familiar or easily accessible to av-\\nerage users.\\nChatGPT Invocation. Our experiments are conducted on\\nChatGPT with its official API [3].\\nTo ensure the repro-\\nducibility of the results, we choose model endpoints “gpt-\\n3.5-turbo-0301” and “gpt-4-0314” as they are the official\\nsnapshots of GPT-3.5 from March 1st, 2023, and GPT-4 from\\nMarch 14th, 2023, with no updates. Following the default\\nsetting, we set the temperature as 1. We take ChatGPT with\\nGPT-3.5 as the basis in the following experiments. For GPT-\\n4, we randomly sample 1,000 questions from our testbed due\\nto the lower response speed and the limit of OpenAI’s restric-\\ntion.2\\nAnswer\\nExtraction.\\nBenefiting\\nfrom\\nChatGPT’s\\ninstruction-following nature [40], we observe ChatGPT’s\\n2The maximum usage OpenAI allows for a user is 120$ each month, which\\nis around 1,000 questions (repeated 5 times) for GPT-4 in our testbed.\\n4\\nresponse in most cases follow the guide we defined in the\\nprompt, facilitating automatic answer extraction for different\\nQA tasks.\\nIn accordance with the required answer types\\noutlined in Section 2.2, we extract the appropriate answer\\nfrom ChatGPT’s responses. Concretely, we extract options\\nselected by ChatGPT, i.e., (A), for YN and MC tasks; the\\nsubstring tokens for EX tasks; and retain the complete Chat-\\nGPT response for AB tasks. For responses that do not follow\\nthe expected format, two human annotators are assigned to\\nindependently extract the answers or determine the refusal\\nreasons. They then discuss and arrive at a conclusion. This\\nis a de facto action taken when acting with LLMs [43].\\nEvaluation. We consider two critical capabilities to assess\\nChatGPT’s reliability: correctness and unanswerable ques-\\ntion identification. First, ChatGPT should answer correctly\\nwhen serving questions (correctness). To measure this ca-\\npability, following previous work [43], we calculate the ac-\\ncuracy for YN and MC tasks; the F1 and RougeL metrics\\nfor EX and AB tasks, respectively. Second, ChatGPT should\\nrecognize situations where no answers can be provided [59].\\nThis capability is particularly vital in sensitive domains like\\nlaw, where the inquirer may lack the expertise to distinguish\\nerrors among answers. To evaluate this capability, we calcu-\\nlate the identification rate of ChatGPT among unanswerable\\nquestions (unanswerable question identification).\\nNote. ChatGPT is essentially a generative language model;\\nhence its answer generation is stochastic. All experiments are\\ntherefore repeated five times and we report the mean values\\nin the rest of the paper.\\n4\\nIs ChatGPT Reliable in Generic Question-\\nAnswering Scenarios?\\nMotivation. ChatGPT’s ability to understand complex ques-\\ntions and generate rich responses in natural language makes\\nthe user interaction a seamless question-and-answer process.\\nThis proficiency may foster trust in ordinary users toward the\\nresponses provided by ChatGPT. However, to the best of our\\nknowledge, current research has not comprehensively bench-\\nmarked if ChatGPT (both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) can provide\\ncorrect answers in various domains (e.g., science, history,\\netc.), and identify situations where no answer should be given\\nin sensitive domains (e.g., law, medicine, etc.). Therefore,\\nwe address these essential questions in this section.\\n4.1\\nCorrectness\\nOverall Correctness. As we can see in Figure 3, ChatGPT’s\\ncorrectness varies across question domains. It achieves good\\ncorrectness on recreation and technology while underper-\\nforming in law and science in most datasets. For instance, the\\ndifferences between the average scores on recreation ques-\\ntions and the overall average scores given YN, MC, EX,\\nand AB tasks are +3.21%, +0.15%, +18.31%, and +4.09%.\\nIn contrast, the differences between the average correctness\\nscores on law questions and those of the same four tasks are\\n-3.18%, -1.62%, -11.97%, and -4.29%.

Figure 4 reports the correctness across\\ndifferent ChatGPT models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4). Overall,\\nwe find that GPT-4 shows slightly better correctness than\\nGPT-3.5. For instance, in the CQA dataset, GPT-4 achieves a\\ncorrectness rate of 79.03%, demonstrating a 2.43% increase\\ncompared to GPT-3.5. However, the performance is still far\\nfrom regarding it as a reliable QA system. By carefully in-\\nspecting answers, we observe similar behaviors on both GPT-\\n3.5 and GPT-4 models. Our results suggest that only relying\\non model upgrades is insufficient to solve reliability issues.\\nQuestion Tense. Tense refers to the grammatical concept\\nindicating when an action or state of being occurs.\\nLan-\\nguage models need to identify question tenses to provide cor-\\nrect answers [52, 55]. To evaluate ChatGPT’s proficiency in\\nvarious tenses, we utilize spaCy3 to conduct morphological\\nanalysis to identify question tense. We present the correct-\\nness with different tenses in Figure 5. Our analysis reveals\\nthat, in most cases, ChatGPT attains slightly better correct-\\nness in present-tense questions. For instance, in the ELI5\\ndataset, present-tense questions yield a mean RougeL score\\nof 0.21, whereas the past-tense question score is only 0.18.\\nWe speculate that this could be due to ChatGPT’s training\\nset bias.

Due\\nto space constraints, we refer the readers to Section A.3 in the\\nAppendix.\\n4.2\\nUnanswerable Question Identification\\nIn addition to providing reliable responses, a crucial capabil-\\nity for large language models is to recognize situations where\\nno answer should be provided. This capability is especially\\ncritical in sensitive domains such as law and medicine, where\\nthe inquirer often lacks the expertise to identify mistakes in\\nthe model’s answers [59]. To evaluate ChatGPT’s reliabil-\\nity in this regard, we measure ChatGPT’s identification rate\\non unanswerable questions marked in the original datasets\\n(see Table 2). As shown in Table 3, ChatGPT only identi-\\nfies 26.63% and 14.29% unanswerable questions with GPT-\\n3.5 and GPT-4 models, respectively. Note that the GPT-4\\nmodel performs even worse in this regard. These low identi-\\nfication rates suggest that ChatGPT tends to make meaning-\\nless guesses rather than reject answers when serving unan-\\nswerable questions. For example, when asked “Who com-\\nposed the tune of ‘Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star’?” where the\\ncomposer is still a mystery in history, and thus no answer\\nshould be offered. ChatGPT incorrectly responds with Wolf-\\ngang Amadeus Mozart as the composer. This finding raises\\nconcerns about ChatGPT’s reliability on unanswerable ques-\\ntions. We hope that this study may motivate future research\\nin this direction.\\n4.3\\nQualitative Analysis\\nFailure Analysis. To investigate possible reasons for Chat-\\nGPT’s suboptimal reliability in the generic QA scenario (see\\nSection 4.1), we randomly sample 100 records in our testbed\\nand inspect the questions, context (if present), correct an-\\nswers, and 5 ChatGPT’s answers towards the same questions\\nto eliminate the randomness. We observe that hallucinatory\\nRACE\\nSQuAD2\\nARC\\nELI5\\nTQA\\nCQA\\nBoolQ\\nMedicine\\nSocial Science\\nScience\\nRecreation\\nGeneral Works\\nTechnology\\nLaw\\nHistory\\nInappropriate (4.0)\\nIt Depends (5.6)\\nNot Mentioned\\n(34.2)\\nNo Knowledge (0.8)\\nFigure 6: Sankey diagram illustrating the refusal reasons. The\\nthickness of each edge corresponds to the number of questions.\\nfacts cause the most common failure and appear in 6.8%\\nChatGPT’s answers on average. For instance, ChatGPT’s an-\\nswer to the law question “In the U.S., can the victim of a do-\\nmestic violence case drop the charges?” is “Yes, the victim\\nof a domestic violence case can choose to drop the charges in\\nthe United States...” This response, however, contradicts the\\nUnited States law and policy.4 Moreover, ChatGPT exhibits\\nother forms of failure, including casual answers (4.8%), ref-\\nerential confusion (3.8%), and lack of knowledge (3.4%).\\nWe suspect this behavior is possibly due to its reasoning lim-\\nitations, as it can only generate responses based on training\\ndata it has processed [16]. Therefore, ChatGPT may not thor-\\noughly understand the physical and social world, leading to\\nincoherent answers. We also make similar observations on\\nGPT-4. We provide examples of each failure reason in Ta-\\nble 10 in the Appendix.\\nRefusal Analysis.\\nWe manually analyze ChatGPT’s re-\\nsponses and identify four primary reasons for refusal: “not\\nmentioned,” “inappropriate,” “it depends,” and “no knowl-\\nedge.” A detailed explanation of each reason, along with ex-\\namples, can be found in Table 11 in the Appendix. We further\\nexclude unanswerable questions from our analysis and focus\\non those that ChatGPT could theoretically answer. Figure 6\\nshows the distribution of refusal reasons. We observe that\\nChatGPT’s most common reason for refusal is that it con-\\nsiders the context insufficient to provide a reliable answer,\\nas indicated by the reason “not mentioned.” For example,\\nwhen asked “Tweed is a rare fabric in modern clothing; what\\nbrand should I look for when buying it?” (see Table 11 in\\nthe Appendix) where the correct answer is option (E) “Eddie\\nBauer” as it is the only brand in the options. However, Chat-\\nGPT believes none of the options are correct and thus refuses\\nto make a choice. This suggests the deficiencies of ChatGPT.\\nIn some cases, ChatGPT may be unable to provide an answer\\nor acknowledge its limitations. Instead, ChatGPT blames the\\nquestion for being ambiguous or poorly worded, potentially\\ninfluencing the user’s judgment of its reliability.\\n4.4\\nTakeaways\\nWe demonstrate that ChatGPT exhibits different reliability\\nin various domains. While ChatGPT shows relatively high\\ncorrectness in the recreation and technology questions, it un-\\nderperforms in law and science domains in most datasets.\\n4https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/legal-advice/\\ndropping-domestic-violence-charge.\\n6\\nWe also identify ChatGPT’s deficiencies in identifying unan-\\nswerable questions with rates of only 26.63% and 14.29% on\\nGPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models, respectively. This suggests that\\nChatGPT is prone to make meaningless guesses rather than\\nrejecting the questions when serving unanswerable ques-\\ntions. With qualitative analysis, we reveal four failure rea-\\nsons and four refusal reasons used by ChatGPT. Interestingly,\\nthe most common reason ChatGPT used to reject questions\\nis “not mentioned” rather than “no knowledge.” Considering\\nquestions in the refusal analysis are all answerable, this indi-\\ncates that ChatGPT may be dishonest in admitting its limita-\\ntions, potentially influencing the user’s judgment of its capa-\\nbility.\\n5\\nDo System Roles Impact ChatGPT’s Relia-\\nbility?\\nMotivation. ChatGPT allows users to leverage its system\\nrole [3] to customize their tasks (i.e., guiding their model’s\\nbehavior by setting up a specific system prompt via OpenAI\\nAPI). This capability has gained immense popularity in the\\ncommunity [2,10,61] and has been incorporated into various\\napplications [5,6,9]. However, a systematic inquiry into the\\nimpact of these system roles on ChatGPT’s reliability is still\\nlacking. We thus fill this gap in this section. We consider\\nfour benign roles, two bad roles, and two jailbreak roles. The\\nbenign roles include an assistant (Assistant), an expert (Ex-\\npert), an expert using zero-shot chain-of-thought prompt [44]\\n(Expert-CoT), and an expert intended to refuse unanswer-\\nable questions (Expert-R). The bad roles include a bad as-\\nsistant (Bad) and a bad assistant with an additional emphasis\\non providing convincing but incorrect answers (Bad-M). We\\nalso consider two in-the-wild jailbreak roles, namely DAN5\\nand ChatAGI.6 These system roles are designed to bypass the\\nsystem’s safeguards and usage policies. DAN, as the name\\nsuggests, aims to instruct ChatGPT to “do anything now”\\nwhile ChatAGI focuses on providing unrestricted answers.\\nAdditional details on these system roles are provided in Ta-\\nble 12 in the Appendix.\\n5.1\\nCorrectness\\nBenign Roles. Table 4 summarizes ChatGPT’s correctness\\nwith different system roles. We observe that benign roles can\\nenhance ChatGPT’s correctness across four QA tasks. Take\\nthe OQA dataset as an example, Assistant, Expert, Expert-\\nCoT, and Expert-R roles improve ChatGPT’s correctness by\\n1.68%, 3.92%, 3.84%, and 1.52%, respectively, compared to\\nthat of ChatGPT without a system role. Additionally, using\\nthe CoT prompt, which instructs users to think step by step,\\ncan further improve ChatGPT’s correctness in some cases.\\nFor instance, the Expert-CoT role achieves 75.10% correct-\\nness on the SQuAD1 dataset, while the Expert and Expert-R\\nroles obtain 72.37% and 71.82% correctness, respectively.\\nHowever, benign roles may underperform in certain datasets.\\n5https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/\\n106azp6/dan_do_anything_now/.\\n6https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/\\n11vc27e/the_2_most_important_bypass_prompts_available/.\\nOn the SQuAD2 dataset, we find that all benign roles fail to\\nimprove ChatGPT’s correctness except for the Expert-R role.\\nWe attribute this drop to the decreased capability of detect-\\ning unanswerable questions (see Section 5.2). To compare,\\nthe Expert-R role, which is instructed to reject unanswerable\\nquestions, improves the correctness by 5.82%.\\nBad Roles. To our surprise, bad roles do not necessarily\\nharm ChatGPT’s correctness.\\nFor instance, the Bad role\\nactually increases ChatGPT’s correctness in most datasets.\\nAs it is only slightly different from the Assistant role, i.e.,\\nby changing “assistant” to “bad assistant” (see Table 12 in\\nthe Appendix), we speculate that ChatGPT might be robust\\nagainst simple negative modal words such as “bad.” Nev-\\nertheless, the Bad-M role, which requires ChatGPT to de-\\nliberately return wrong answers, results in an apparent de-\\ncrease in correctness across most datasets. For example, in\\nthe CQA dataset, the Bad-M role reduces correctness from\\n76.60% (W/o role) to 37.10%.\\nJailbreak Roles. We find that jailbreak roles can also af-\\nfect ChatGPT’s correctness, especially the DAN role, which\\ndrops the correctness of all datasets except the ELI5 dataset.\\nFor example, ChatGPT with the DAN role obtains 65.08%\\ncorrectness on the RACE dataset, which represents almost a\\n19.55% drop compared to that of ChatGPT without a system\\nrole. Moreover, for both the DAN and ChatAGI roles, the\\ncorrectness on SQuAD2 heavily decreases from 44.07% to\\n34.71% and 39.36%, respectively. By manually inspecting\\nthe responses, we speculate that this might be credited to the\\npurpose of the two jailbreak roles. Recall that the main pur-\\npose of the jailbreak roles is to break restrictions imposed by\\nChatGPT’s safeguards. The side effect is that they may also\\nforce ChatGPT to find meaningless answers to unanswerable\\nquestions to comply with the instructions. We provide addi-\\ntional analysis in Section 5.2.\\n5.2\\nUnanswerable Question Identification\\nWe report ChatGPT’s unanswerable question identification\\nratio in Figure 7a. Surprisingly, we find that almost all sys-\\ntem roles decrease ChatGPT’s ability to detect unanswerable\\nquestions, particularly the jailbreak roles. For instance, when\\ninstructed within the DAN role, ChatGPT can only identify\\n9.07% of unanswerable questions. This decrease can be at-\\ntributed to the purpose of jailbreak roles, which are designed\\nto motivate ChatGPT to actively answer questions, poten-\\ntially impacting its ability to detect unanswerable questions.\\nAdditionally, the Expert-R role shows improved identifica-\\ntion capability in this scenario, with a rate of 29.36%. This\\nimprovement can be credited to the instruction to refuse un-\\ncertain questions. However, even with the improved result,\\nthe detection rate is still far from satisfactory.\\n5.3\\nQualitative Analysis\\nFailure Analysis. We reuse the same 100 questions in Sec-\\ntion 4.3 to better understand how different system roles affect\\nChatGPT’s correctness (see Figure 7b). We find that benign\\nsystem roles increase the reliability of ChatGPT by reduc-\\ning the hallucinatory facts and casual answers, however, they\\n7\\nTable 4: ChatGPT’s correctness with different system roles.

In addition, bad roles and jailbreak\\nroles show a tendency to increase all four kinds of failures.\\nFor example, DAN induces ChatGPT to produce 4% more\\nhallucinatory facts in its generated answers. By carefully in-\\nvestigating ChatGPT’s answers, we find ChatGPT with sys-\\ntem roles tends to supply more convincing statements, e.g.,\\ndetailed fake data or irrelative theory, to support its false an-\\nswers, making it more challenging to identify whether its an-\\nswers are true or false. Table 7 in the Appendix shows a\\ntypical example of hallucinatory facts. When answering the\\nquestion “Which states are more obese than West Virginia”,\\nChatGPT with benign and bad roles, i.e., Expert-CoT and\\nBad, both claim their answers refer to the data from CDC\\nin 2019 or 2020 with specific numbers, which are both fake.\\nBased on these observations, we find that ChatGPT is still\\nlimited and unreliable when answering questions, even with\\nsystem roles. Moreover, the fake data or irrelative theory pro-\\nvided by ChatGPT with system roles can cause users to trust\\nits answers without verifying the accuracy themselves. As a\\nresult, the false information generated by ChatGPT becomes\\nharder to detect and inadvertently spreads more easily.\\nRefusal Analysis. Figure 7c shows the rejected numbers of\\nanswerable questions. We first notice that all system roles\\nenable ChatGPT to reject fewer questions, except the Expert-\\nR role. This is expected, as the Expert-R role encourages\\nChatGPT to carefully consider questions and refuse uncer-\\ntain ones (see Table 12 in the Appendix). Among all the\\nrest system roles, interestingly, we find that the two jailbreak\\nroles do not perform as well as the Expert-CoT role in re-\\nducing ChatGPT’s rejected question numbers, even though\\nthis is their main design purpose. For instance, the DAN and\\nChatAGI roles only reduce ChatGPT’s rejected number from\\n28.6 to 15 and 13.4, respectively, while the Expert-CoT role\\nobtains the lowest number of rejected questions, i.e., 12.2\\nquestions. Our finding indicates the ineffectiveness of these\\nin-the-wild jailbreak roles. Even with multiple manually op-\\ntimized instructions, these jailbreak roles fail to decrease the\\nrejected number as effectively as the Expert-CoT role, a sim-\\nple system role with only one additional instruction.\\n5.4\\nTakeaways\\nWe find that system roles may directly influence ChatGPT’s\\nreliability.\\nFor instance, benign roles (Assistant, Expert,\\nExpert-CoT, and Expert-R) improve ChatGPT’s correctness\\non four QA tasks, while bad and jailbreak roles usually re-\\nduce ChatGPT’s correctness and force it to select meaning-\\nless answers to unanswerable questions. We argue these ob-\\nservations on system roles are critical and must be given at-\\ntention by users. System roles possess the capability to not\\nonly steer ChatGPT’s behaviors but also impact its correct-\\nness as well as decrease its unanswerable question detecting\\nratio. Worse, its impact is not easily discernible from the\\nsystem role itself. For instance, a jailbreak role may aim to\\nbreak restrictions but ultimately result in decreased correct-\\nness. This finding highlights the need to search for more\\nreliable system roles and thoroughly evaluate the reliability\\nof the system role before applying it to a real application.\\n6\\nCan ChatGPT Respond Reliably When Fac-\\ning Adversarial Examples?\\nMotivation. Based on our findings in RQ1 and RQ2, we\\nhave identified several factors that can impact ChatGPT’s re-\\n8\\nliability, including question domains and system roles. Given\\nChatGPT’s unprecedented popularity, it is inevitable that ma-\\nlicious users will, if not already, attack ChatGPT by carefully\\ncrafting adversarial examples as its input. In this section,\\nwe present our analysis of ChatGPT’s reliability against ad-\\nversarial examples. These adversarial examples preserve the\\nsemantic meaning while allowing us to analyze ChatGPT’s\\nbehavior given varying degrees of perturbations.\\n6.1\\nThreat Model\\nAdversary’s Goals. Following previous work in adversarial\\nattacks [27, 37, 39, 48, 75], the adversary’s goal is to utilize\\nperturbed but semantic-preserving questions to elicit erro-\\nneous responses from ChatGPT. Ideally, the perturbed ques-\\ntions should satisfy the following criteria.\\n• Effectiveness. The perturbed questions should effec-\\ntively induce ChatGPT to generate wrong answers.\\n• Quality. The perturbed questions should maintain the\\nsemantic meaning and fluency of the original questions\\nwhile minimizing grammatical errors or modifications.\\n• Efficiency. The adversary should identify the perturbed\\nquestion that can achieve the desired effect with min-\\nimal queries, as ChatGPT’s API incurs a charge per\\nquery.\\nAdversary’s Capabilities. We assume that the adversary op-\\nerates in a real-world setting and has only limited capabili-\\nties. Specifically, the adversary is only able to query Chat-\\nGPT and has no access to the model weights, output proba-\\nbilities, hyperparameters, or configuration documents.\\n6.2\\nMethodology\\nDecision-Based Adversarial Attacks.\\nWe consider five\\ndecision-based adversarial attacks: VIPER [27], Nat [13],\\nSwap [13], Synonyms [15], and SCPN [37]. VIPER [27]\\nmodifies questions at the character level by replacing char-\\nacters with their nearest visual neighbors, e.g., “a” to “â.”\\nNat [13] collects naturally occurring errors, such as typos and\\nmisspellings, from available corpora and utilizes a look-up\\ntable for possible lexical replacements. Swap [13] introduces\\nartificial noises into questions by swapping letters among the\\nwords. Synonyms [15] generates adversarial examples by re-\\nplacing words with their synonyms based on predefined sub-\\nstitution rules. SCPN [37] is a sentence-level adversarial at-\\ntack that produces paraphrases of the target questions using\\na pre-trained model and syntax templates.\\nScore-Based Adversarial Attacks. We manually engineer a\\nprompt, namely leakage prompt, to induce ChatGPT to leak\\nthe confidence score for potential answer candidates. The\\nprompt consists of two restriction sentences for the answer,\\none sentence to explain the meaning of the confidence score\\nand a one-shot learning example to guide ChatGPT to gen-\\nerate output in an extractable format. The final version of\\nleakage prompt is:\\nQuestion: [Question]\\nOnly return your confidence score for each option. Do not\\nexplain. Higher means you think it’s more likely to be the\\ncorrect answer. For example, {“A”: 0.9, “B”: 0.1, “C”: 0.2,\\n“D”: 0.1}.”\\nAnswer: [MASK]\\nNote that in the leakage prompt, the sum of the confidence\\nscores is not necessarily equal to 1. We find this format to\\nbe more effective in eliciting ChatGPT’s confidence score\\nduring prompt design.\\nWe carefully verify that the con-\\nfidence scores obtained by leakage prompt match the cor-\\nrect answers (additional details are outlined in Section A.2).\\nConsequently, this leakage prompt enables us to measure\\nChatGPT’s resilience against score-based adversarial attacks.\\nWith the observation that character-level and sentence-level\\nattacks can achieve high attack success rates in most datasets\\nwhereas the word-level attack struggles to do so (see Ta-\\nble 5), we question whether this is due to the ChatGPT’s re-\\nliability towards word-level perturbations or the limitations\\nof the attack method itself.\\nIn our study, we then utilize\\nthe confidence scores to perform TextFooler [39], a repre-\\nsentative score-based word-level adversarial attack on Chat-\\nGPT. Specifically, given a target question, TextFooler con-\\nsists of two main steps. First, TextFooler identifies impor-\\ntant words with confidence scores. Then, TextFooler replaces\\nthem with the most semantically similar and grammatically\\ncorrect words until the response from ChatGPT is altered.\\n6.3\\nExperiment Settings\\nDataset. We randomly sample 65 correctly answered YN\\nand MC questions for the evaluation of adversarial exam-\\nples. These questions act as the ground truth since ChatGPT\\nresponds correctly without adversarial perturbation.\\nTarget Model.\\nWe consider ChatGPT instructed by the\\nExpert-CoT role as our target model. We choose this system\\nrole as it shows the best reliability in the previous evaluation\\n(see Section 5).\\nEvaluation Metrics. We employ seven metrics to assess the\\nthree aforementioned criteria. Effectiveness is measured by\\nAttack Success Rate. Quality is evaluated based on Lev-\\nenshtein Edit Distance, Fluency, Word Modification Rate,\\nSemantic Similarity, and Grammatical Errors. Efficiency is\\nassessed by examining the Number of Queries required to\\nachieve the intended results.\\n• Attack Success Rate (ASR). ASR represents the frac-\\ntion of adversarial examples that ChatGPT answers in-\\ncorrectly.\\n• Levenshtein Edit Distance (LED). The LED measures\\nthe minimum number of operations needed to transform\\nthe original text into the adversarial example.\\n• Fluency. Fluency measures the quality of the adversar-\\nial example, calculated by the perplexity metric.\\n• Word Modification Rate (WMR). The WMR is the\\npercentage of modified words in the adversarial exam-\\nple compared with the original question.\\n9\\n• Semantic Similarity. The semantic similarity measures\\nthe similarity between the original questions and adver-\\nsarial examples using Universal Sentence Encoder\\n• Grammatical Errors. The grammatical errors are the\\nnumber of errors in the adversarial example’s grammar\\nusing LanguageTool.7\\n• Number of Queries. The number of queries is the aver-\\nage number of queries on ChatGPT attempted to attain\\nthe attack goal. For all decision-based attacks, we re-\\nstrict the maximum query times to 10 per question.\\nWe also provide qualitative analysis to manually inspect the\\nreasons for the success of adversarial examples.\\n6.4\\nQuantitative Evaluation\\nEffectiveness. Table 5 shows the results of various adver-\\nsarial attacks on ChatGPT. Overall, we find that ChatGPT\\ncan be easily misled by existing adversarial attacks. Syn-\\nonyms attack is the only exception, as it has a considerably\\nlower ASR score compared to other attacks on the BoolQ\\ndataset. Our perturbation level analysis reveals that sentence-\\nlevel attacks, such as SCNP, usually yield higher ASR scores\\nthan character- and word-level attacks. This is evidenced by\\nsentence-level perturbation achieving an ASR score of 0.65\\non the CQA dataset, the highest among the three. This is as\\nexpected, as the sentence-level attack has more freedom to\\nmodify the target question (see Table 6).\\nAmong the three character-level attacks, we find Nat and\\nVIPER usually achieve higher ASR than Swap. This finding\\nimplies that ChatGPT exhibits proficiency in handling arti-\\nficial noises, but is less adept at coping with natural noises\\nand visual perturbations. Since natural noise and visual per-\\nturbations are prevalent in human-generated text, such as ty-\\npographical errors and slang terms, there is a need to further\\nenhance ChatGPT’s reliability to these challenges.\\nMoreover, we observe that Synonyms attack is ineffective\\nin most datasets, with an average ASR of 0.004. This result\\nsuggests that ChatGPT is proficient in recognizing and com-\\nprehending synonyms. However, when the adversary has ac-\\ncess to additional information from ChatGPT, i.e., utilizing\\nleakage prompt to conduct a more advanced attack, the av-\\nerage ASR increases to 0.38. This result highlights the se-\\nvere potential for advanced adversarial examples exploiting\\nChatGPT’s vulnerabilities, underscoring the need for further\\nresearch to enhance its security and privacy.\\nQuality. Overall, we find that word-level adversarial exam-\\nples achieve the best utility in most cases. In the case of the\\nCQA dataset, Synonyms and TextFooler achieve 0.93 and\\n0.76 semantic similarities. In contrast, VIPER, Swap, Nat,\\nand SCPN only achieve 0.22, 0.29, 0.37, and 0.68 seman-\\ntic similarities, respectively. This difference in quality is due\\nto the fact that word-level attacks replace words with syn-\\nonyms, which allows the questions to retain their semantics.\\nWe also find adversarial examples generated by VIPER are\\n7https://www.languagetool.org.\\nmore fluent than those generated by other methods. Specif-\\nically, VIPER achieves a perplexity score of 304.81 in the\\nBoolQ dataset, while Swap, Nat, Synonyms, TextFooler, and\\nSCPN have perplexity scores of 1286.87, 5936.50, 752.26,\\n1533.38, and 427.16, respectively. This finding highlights\\nthe importance of visual perturbation in achieving fluency.\\nEfficiency. We evaluate the efficiency of adversarial attacks\\nby analyzing the query number required for each method.\\nAs presented in Table 5, score-based adversarial attacks re-\\nquire a significantly higher number of queries than decision-\\nbased attacks. This is due to the fact that score-based at-\\ntacks need to interactively query ChatGPT to obtain the con-\\nfidence score for each word, which is then used to calcu-\\nlate the word’s importance. In contrast, different decision-\\nbased attacks have a similar number of queries to attain the\\nattack goal. The average query number on ARC is 8.00, 9.14,\\n8.14, 1.00, and 2.71 for VIPER, Swap, Nat, Synonyms, and\\nSCPN, respectively. It is worth noting that existing adver-\\nsarial attacks with high attack success rates still require sev-\\neral interactions with ChatGPT to find successful adversarial\\nexamples for a specific target question, except for YN tasks.\\nThis may serve as an indicator for the defender to proactively\\nidentify the adversaries and implement mitigation measures\\nbefore a successful adversarial example is found.\\n6.5\\nQualitative Analysis\\nBy manually inspecting ChatGPT’s answers to the adversar-\\nial examples, we find that adversarial examples lead Chat-\\nGPT to a wrong reasoning direction.\\nTable 6 shows one\\nrandomly sampled adversarial example. When asked by the\\nadversarial example “Brids caryring aawy furit hleps the\\ntere?” ChatGPT responds “The answer is (A) grow. Ex-\\nplanation: Birds play a crucial role in seed dispersal. When\\nthey eat fruits or berries, the seeds pass through their diges-\\ntive system ... then scattered and germinate in new places,\\nallowing for the growth and expansion of the plant species.\\nTherefore, birds carrying away fruit can help a tree to grow.”\\nWe notice that the last sentence recovers the original ques-\\ntion, indicating that ChatGPT can identify typographical er-\\nrors and rectify them. However, when looking at the explana-\\ntion, the adversarial example misleads ChatGPT’s perception\\nof a tree, i.e., conflating the concept of a tree with that of a\\nplant species. This results in incorrect reasoning, leading to\\nan incorrect answer.\\nWe are also surprised to find that ChatGPT’s perception\\ncan be affected by only one character in some cases. For in-\\nstance, when provided “birds carrying away fruit assists the\\ntree” (Synonyms attack), ChatGPT chooses the correct an-\\nswer (C) reproduce. However, once we modify “assists” to\\n“assist” (TextFooler attack), ChatGPT goes for (D) conquer.\\nFor the latter one, ChatGPT explains “Birds are known to\\ndisperse seeds by eating fruits and then excreting seeds in dif-\\nferent locations, which helps the tree to colonize new habitats\\nand expand its range to conquer new territories ...” This ex-\\nplanation shows the conflation of ChatGPT on the concept of\\na single tree with the plant species but ended in the conquer\\nperspective. These misleading reasoning processes suggest\\nChatGPT’s unreliability in generic question-answering sce-\\n10\\nTable 5: Evaluation results of adversarial attacks on ChatGPT (ordered by perturbation level). “Char,” “Word,” and “Sentence” refers\\nto character-, word-, and sentence-level perturbations.

These results\\ndemonstrate the vulnerability of ChatGPT to adversarial at-\\ntacks and highlight the need for building safeguards to en-\\nhance its reliability.\\n7\\nDiscussion\\n7.1\\nSocial Implications\\nChatGPT’s reliability has emerged as a critical security con-\\ncern since its release. Numerous users have been misled by\\nChatGPT’s unreliable responses and resulted in significant\\nreal-life repercussions [22, 68, 72].\\nOur paper contributes\\nby providing, for the first time, a comprehensive large-\\nscale measurement of ChatGPT’s reliability in the generic\\nquestion-answering (QA) scenario. These findings have the\\n11\\nfollowing important social implications: 1) they help set\\nuser expectations regarding ChatGPT’s reliability; 2) they\\noffer valuable insights for researchers to improve its relia-\\nbility, such as fine-tuning ChatGPT on truthful law and sci-\\nence data. Moreover, we find 6.8% ChatGPT’s answers in-\\nclude hallucinatory facts. Although the ratio is low, consid-\\nering ChatGPT’s enormous usage, i.e., 1 billion queries per\\nday [1], a large amount of false information must have been\\ngenerated, read, and even unintentionally disseminated. How\\nto effectively identify and mitigate ChatGPT-generated false\\ninformation has become a critical problem that needs to be\\nurgently addressed.\\nAlso, the security issues of ChatGPT cannot be ignored.\\nOur study demonstrates that ChatGPT is vulnerable to adver-\\nsarial examples, with even a single character change in cer-\\ntain cases, thereby posing significant security risks. The po-\\ntential risks become increasingly magnified as ChatGPT con-\\ntinues to be integrated into numerous applications and gains\\naccess to users’ emails, social accounts, and private docu-\\nments [7, 8]. Therefore, ensuring robust security measures\\nshould be consideration in the development and deployment\\nof ChatGPT.\\n7.2\\nActionable Guidance\\nTo enhance ChatGPT’s reliability, we discuss actionable\\nguidance along the supply chain of ChatGPT, including data\\nquality, in-context learning, and post-processing interven-\\ntions.\\nData Quality. Improving the training data quality is a po-\\ntential avenue for enhancing ChatGPT’s reliability. As it is\\ntrained on a diverse range of sources, including web pages\\nand books [1], there is a possibility that the training data may\\ncontain contradictory or incorrect information, thus limiting\\nits reliability. Therefore, improving data quality for model\\ntraining can enhance the reliability of ChatGPT. However, it\\nis worth noting that building a high-quality training dataset\\nof such magnitude, i.e., approximately 300B words [1, 18],\\ncan pose significant challenges regarding computational re-\\nsources and associated costs.\\nIn-context Learning. In-context learning allows users to\\nprompt LLMs with instructions or demonstrations to solve\\na task without any additional training.\\nPrevious studies\\nhave shown that in-context learning can improve language\\nmodels’ performance by carefully selecting the demonstra-\\ntions [53]. Thus, it presents a straightforward approach for\\nusers to better utilize ChatGPT. However, in-context learn-\\ning also has its limitations. First, users are required to find\\nsuitable demonstrations before posing their questions, which\\ncan increase the overall usage cost and effort. Moreover, it\\nstill cannot fully address the inherent misknowledge inside\\nthe model.\\nPost-processing Interventions.\\nAnother approach to en-\\nhance ChatGPT’s reliability is to implement post-processing\\ninterventions for the output of the model. Currently, OpenAI\\nclaims it “may produce inaccurate information about people,\\nplaces, or facts” in the web interface of ChatGPT [4]. How-\\never, this statement alone is insufficient as it places the bur-\\nden of assessing the veracity of the information on the user.\\nProactive measures can be taken to address this limitation.\\nFor example, the model provider can deploy a false informa-\\ntion detector as part of a risk management solution to iden-\\ntify and flag potentially inaccurate or misleading responses.\\nOnce detected, they can guide users to verification resources,\\nsuch as fact-checking websites, credible news organizations,\\nor relevant government agencies.\\n7.3\\nLimitations\\nOur work has several limitations. First, we only consider En-\\nglish questions in our evaluation. However, ChatGPT’s relia-\\nbility may vary across different languages due to differences\\nin grammar, syntax, and culture. Furthermore, our study on\\nsystem roles only involves manually crafted roles. In real-\\nity, users can create versatile system roles, which may have\\nvaried impacts on ChatGPT’s reliability. Despite these lim-\\nitations, our study sheds light on the ChatGPT’s reliability\\nacross question domains, system roles, and adversarial at-\\ntacks.\\n8\\nRelated Work\\nEvaluation on Large Language Models. While large lan-\\nguage models (LLMs) have emerged as the foundation for\\nalmost all major language tasks, researchers have expressed\\nconcerns regarding their capability, robustness, consistency,\\nand potential risks [12, 14, 16, 38, 49, 59, 69, 71]. Bang et al.\\n[12] evaluate ChatGPT in traditional NLP tasks with 30 to\\n200 data samples for each task. They find ChatGPT is only\\ngood at language abilities rather than actual reasoning, which\\nmakes it an unreliable reasoner. Jang and Lukasiewicz [38]\\nstudy ChatGPT’s trustworthiness regarding logically consis-\\ntent behaviors and observe ChatGPT fails to generate logi-\\ncally correct predictions frequently. Wang et al. [69] con-\\nduct an assessment of ChatGPT’s robustness from the ad-\\nversarial and out-of-distribution (OOD) perspective. They\\nfind ChatGPT shows consistent robustness on most classi-\\nfication tasks, but its performance is still far from perfec-\\ntion. Borji [16] empirical conclude 11 categories of Chat-\\nGPT’s failures, including reasoning, factual errors, math,\\ncoding, and so on.\\nIn addition to these functional con-\\ncerns, studies analyzing ChatGPT’s characteristics find that\\nit holds pro-environmental and left-libertarian political ide-\\nology [34], shows social stereotypes and unfair discrimina-\\ntion [43], and can be easily misled by the wrong knowledge\\npassed in the prompt [76]. Different from previous studies, in\\nthis paper, we focus on ChatGPT’s reliability in the generic\\nQA scenario. We not only build a larger and more compre-\\nhensive testbed, but also provide insights into question do-\\nmains, system roles, and adversarial attacks, which have not\\nbeen addressed by prior studies.\\nSecurity Risks of Large Language Models. Previous stud-\\nies have also shown that LLM is vulnerable to various types\\nof attacks, such as adversarial attacks [27, 30, 37, 39], back-\\ndoor attacks [11, 21], prompt injection [31, 57], obfusca-\\ntion [40], and data extraction attacks [19]. Bagdasaryan and\\nShmatikov [11] investigate meta-backdoor attacks that cause\\nthe language model to generate incorrect outputs with the\\n12\\ntrigger. Kang et al. [40] show that the defense of LLMs can\\nbe bypassed with classical security attacks such as obfusca-\\ntion, code injection, and virtualization. LLMs can be also\\nmisused for phishing [54], plagiarism [35, 66], misinforma-\\ntion generation [16], malicious code generation [56], and so\\non. The significant security risks posed by these works high-\\nlight the critical role of reliability in LLMs. In this paper, we\\naim to shed light on ChatGPT’s reliability in the generic QA\\nscenario. We hope our study can provide insights into the\\ncommunity and pave the way toward building reliable LLMs\\nin the future.\\n9\\nConclusion\\nThis paper presents the first large-scale measurement of\\nChatGPT’s reliability from three perspectives: 1) perfor-\\nmance in generic QA scenarios, 2) impacts of system roles,\\nand 3) its vulnerability to adversarial examples. Our find-\\nings indicate that ChatGPT’s reliability varies across differ-\\nent domains, with noticeable underperformance in law and\\nscience questions. We also, for the first time, systematically\\nexplore the impacts of system roles on ChatGPT’s reliabil-\\nity. We find that they not only steer ChatGPT’s behavior but\\nalso affect its reliability in ways that are not always evident\\nfrom the role description. We further assess ChatGPT’s reli-\\nability towards malicious inputs and find that sentence-level\\nand character-level adversarial examples can be effectively\\nmounted against ChatGPT. Our results provide insights to the\\nsecurity research community regarding ChatGPT’s reliabil-\\nity and highlight the need for developing reliable and secure\\nLLMs.\\nAcknowledgments.

CoRR abs/2302.13793, 2023. 1, 12\\nA\\nAppendix\\nA.1\\nDetailed Explanation of Datasets\\n• BoolQ [24] is a yes/no reading comprehension dataset.\\nThe questions are derived from aggregated Google\\nsearches. The answers (yes/no) are marked by human\\nannotators if certain Wikipedia pages contain sufficient\\ninformation to address the questions.\\n• OpenbookQA (OQA) [51] is a multiple-choice rea-\\nsoning dataset. The questions are derived from 1,326\\ncore science facts. The answers consist of 4 candidates,\\nof which only one is correct, requiring reasoning be-\\ntween questions and the given science facts and com-\\nmon knowledge.\\n• RACE [46] is a multiple-choice reading comprehension\\ndataset. The questions are derived from English exams\\nfor Chinese students. The answers include 4 candidates,\\nof which only one is correct, requiring reading compre-\\nhension of English passages.\\n• ARC [25] is a multiple-choice reasoning dataset. The\\nquestions are derived from science exams (student level\\nranging from 3rd grade to 9th) that are incorrectly an-\\nswered by retrieval-based and word co-occurrence al-\\ngorithms [25]. The answers consist of 4 candidates, of\\nwhich only one is correct, requiring decent knowledge\\nand reasoning in natural science.\\n• CommonsenseQA (CQA) [67] is a multiple-choice\\nreasoning dataset.\\nThe questions are derived from\\nknowledge encoded in ConceptNet [64]. The answers\\ncomprise 5 candidates, of which only one is correct, re-\\nquiring background knowledge that is trivial to humans\\nbut non-trivial to ML models’ reasoning capability.\\n• SQuAD1 [60] is an extractive reading comprehension\\ndataset. The questions are derived from Wikipedia ar-\\nticles. The answers should be extracted from the given\\ncontext (i.e., paragraphs) associated with the questions.\\n• SQuAD2 [59] combines questions in SQuAD1 with\\nunanswerable questions written by crowd workers. The\\nunanswerable questions resemble answerable ones but\\ncannot be found in the given context.\\n• NarrativeQA (NQA) [42] is an abstractive full docu-\\nment comprehension dataset. The questions are derived\\nfrom stories, such as books and movie scripts.\\nThe\\nanswers are human-generated free-form text using just\\nsummaries or the full story text.\\n• ELI5 [28] is an abstractive full document comprehen-\\nsion dataset. The questions are derived from the threads\\nin the “Explain Like I’m Five” (ELI5) subreddit (an on-\\nline community that provides answers to questions that\\nare comprehensible by five-year-olds). The answers are\\nfree-form text with the highest voting scores in those\\nthreads.\\n16\\nTable 7: Example of failure analysis with different system roles.\\nQuestion Which states are more obese than West Virginia\\nAnswer\\nNo states are more obese than West Virginia\\nW/o\\nAccording to recent studies, the states with higher obesity\\nrates than West Virginia include Mississippi, Arkansas,\\nKentucky, Tennessee, and Louisiana ...\\nExpert-\\nCoT\\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-\\ntion (CDC) data, as of 2020, the following states have a\\nhigher percentage of obese adults (BMI of 30 or higher)\\nthan West Virginia, which has the highest obesity rate in\\nthe United States: 1. Mississippi, 2. Alabama ...\\nBad\\nBased on data from the Centers for Disease Control and\\nPrevention (CDC), as of 2019, the following states have\\na higher percentage of adult obesity than West Virginia\\n(which has a rate of 35.6%): 1. Mississippi - 39.7%; 2.\\nAlabama - 36.2% ...\\n• TruthfulQA (TQA) [50] is an abstractive truthfulness\\ndataset.\\nIt was recently introduced to understand if\\nLLMs can avoid generating false answers learned from\\nimitating human texts. The questions, spanning 38 cat-\\negories (e.g., medicine, law, and finance), are single-\\nsentence questions and purposely designed so that some\\nhumans would answer wrongly due to a false belief or\\nmisconception. Each question has sets of true and false\\nreference answers and a source that supports the an-\\nswers.\\nA.2\\nEvaluation of Leakage Prompt\\nFigure 8 shows the confidence score distribution obtained\\nwith leakage prompt on correct-answer questions. We find\\nthe confidence score distribution meets our expectations. If\\nthe correct answer is (A), then option (A) should have the\\nhighest confidence score, which is also reflected in the plot.\\nThis evaluation proves the usability of leakage prompt.\\nA\\nB\\nC\\nD\\nE\\n0.00\\n0.25\\n0.50\\n0.75\\n1.00\\n(a) Answer (A)\\nA\\nB\\nC\\nD\\nE\\n0.00\\n0.25\\n0.50\\n0.75\\n1.00\\n(b) Answer (B)\\nA\\nB\\nC\\nD\\nE\\n0.00\\n0.25\\n0.50\\n0.75\\n1.00\\n(c) Answer (C)\\nA\\nB\\nC\\nD\\nE\\n0.00\\n0.25\\n0.50\\n0.75\\n1.00\\n(d) Answer (D)\\nFigure 8: Confidence score distribution on correct-answer ques-\\ntions. The result for option (E) is not displayed since no question\\nhas (E) as the correct answer in the sample data.\\nA.3\\nImpacts of Question Fluency\\nWe also investigate the relationship between question flu-\\nency, ChatGPT answer fluency, and the corresponding cor-\\nrectness. Concretely, we measure the fluency of the gener-\\nated questions and answers using the perplexity (PPL) met-\\nric [58, 75]. A higher PPL indicates the sentence is less flu-\\nent. Figure 9a and Figure 10a in the Appendix displays the\\nbivariate distribution of questions and ChatGPT answer flu-\\nency. We exclude the EX task, as its answers are typically\\ntoo short for a representative perplexity score. Our analysis\\nreveals a positive correlation between question fluency and\\nChatGPT answer fluency, with a Pearson correlation coef-\\nficient of 0.1 (p < 0.1) in almost all datasets, except for the\\nBoolQ and TruthfulQA datasets. This suggests that ChatGPT\\ntends to answer in the same ambiguous way if a question is\\nless fluent. This, in turn, leads to unstable reliability, as illus-\\ntrated in Figure 9b and Figure 10b in the Appendix, where\\nwe see an increase in the standard variance (indicated by the\\nshadow area) as the question perplexity increases. However,\\nit is difficult to conclude whether higher question perplexity\\nresults in better or worse ChatGPT reliability, as we observe\\ndifferent tendencies across datasets.\\n102\\n104\\nQuestion PPL\\n101\\n102\\n103\\nAnswer PPL\\nBoolQ (Acc)\\n103\\nQuestion PPL\\n101\\n102\\nOQA (Acc)\\n102\\n104\\nQuestion PPL\\n102\\n104\\nNQA (RougeL)\\n(a) Fluency distribution of questions and ChatGPT answers.\\nColor darkness represents the question count.\\n102\\n103\\nQuestion PPL\\n0\\n25\\n50\\n75\\n100\\nCorrectness (%)\\nBoolQ (Acc)\\n102\\n104\\nQuestion PPL\\n0\\n25\\n50\\n75\\n100\\nOQA (Acc)\\n102\\n104\\nQuestion PPL\\n0\\n25\\n50\\n75\\n100\\nNQA (RougeL)\\n(b) Correctness distribution under fluency.

(Answer: No, the\\nvictim cannot drop the charges\\nonce a prosecutor is involved.)\\nYes, the victim of a domestic violence case can choose to drop the charges in\\nthe United States, but it is important to note that the decision to do so is often\\ncomplex and can have serious consequences. The decision to press charges\\nis ultimately up to the victim, but it is important to consider the safety and\\nwell-being of everyone involved.

A toaster converts electrical en-\\nergy into heat energy to toast bread, much like a campfire toasts bread. The\\nheat generated by the toaster is used to cook the bread, just as the heat from\\nthe campfire is used to cook the bread. Explanation: (A) “a campfire toasts\\nbread” is the correct answer because both a toaster and a campfire use heat to\\ncook food, in this case, toast bread. (B) “a microwave heats soup” is incorrect\\nbecause a microwave uses microwave radiation to heat food, not heat energy.\\n(C) “a fire burns paper” is incorrect because a fire is a chemical reaction that\\nreleases heat and light, not just heat. (D) “a small oven works” is incorrect\\nbecause an oven uses heat energy to cook food, but it is not specifically men-\\ntioned as toasting bread.\\nReferential\\nconfusion\\nLions and tigers will not kill or\\neat men _ . (A) unless men try to\\nrun away (B) if they are too old\\nand too weak (C) if they are able\\nto get enough food (D) however\\nmen act towards them (Answer:\\nC)\\nThe answer is (B) if they are too old and too weak. According to the article,\\nlions and tigers will only kill and eat men when they have grown too old and\\ntoo weak to catch their usual food, such as deer and other small animals.\\n19\\nTable 11: Four refusal reasons given by ChatGPT.
